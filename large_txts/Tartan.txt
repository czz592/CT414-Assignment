*Tartan* (Scottish Gaelic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Gaelic_language>: /breacan/ [ˈpɾʲɛxkən] <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Scottish_Gaelic>) is a patterned cloth
with crossing horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours, forming
simple or complex rectangular patterns. Tartans originated in woven
wool, but are now made in other materials. Tartan is particularly
associated with Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland>, and
Scottish kilts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt> almost always have
tartan patterns. The earliest surviving samples of tartan-style cloth
are around 3,000 years old and were discovered in Xinjiang <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang>, China.

Outside of Scotland, tartan is sometimes also known as
"*plaid*" (particularly in North America); however, in Scotland, a /
plaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_plaid>/ is a large piece of
tartan cloth which can be worn several ways.

Traditional tartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed)
threads woven in usually matching warp and weft <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft> in a simple 2/2 twill <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twill> pattern. Up close, this pattern forms
alternating short diagonal lines where different colours cross; from
further back, it gives the appearance of new colours blended from the
original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and
horizontally in a distinctive pattern of rectangles and lines known as
a /sett/.

Scottish tartan was originally associated with the Highlands <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands>. Early tartans were only
particular to locales, rather than any specific Scottish clan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_clan>; like other materials, tartan
designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes, using the most
available natural dyes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_dye>. The
Dress Act of 1746 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_Act_1746>
attempted to bring the warrior clans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_clan> there under government control by banning Highland dress
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_dress>, then an important
element of Gaelic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaels> Scottish culture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Scotland>. When the law was
repealed in 1782, tartan was no longer ordinary dress for most
Highlanders. It was adopted more widely as the symbolic national dress
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_dress> of all Scotland when King
George IV wore a tartan kilt in his 1822 visit to Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visit_of_George_IV_to_Scotland>; it was promoted
further by Queen Victoria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Queen_Victoria>. This marked an era of rather politicised "tartanry" and
"Highlandism" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartanry>.

While the first uniform tartan is believed to date to 1713 (with some
evidence of militia use earlier), it was not until around the early 19th
century that patterns were created for specific Scottish clans;^[1]
<#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> most of the traditional ones were
established between 1815 and 1850. The Victorian-era <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era> invention of artificial dyes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniline#Synthetic_dye_industry> meant
that a multitude of patterns could be produced cheaply; mass-produced
tartan fashion cloth was applied to a nostalgic <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia> (and increasingly aristocratic, and
profitable) view of Scottish history.

Today /tartan/ is no longer limited to textiles <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile>, but is also used as a name for the
pattern itself, regardless of medium. The use of tartan has spread
outside Scotland, especially to countries that have been influenced by
Scottish culture <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_culture>.
However, tartan-styled patterns have existed for centuries in some other
cultures, such as Japan, where complex /kōshi/ fabrics date to at least
the 18th century, and Russia (sometimes with gold and silver thread)
since at least the early 19th century. Maasai /shúkà/ wraps, Bhutanese /
mathra/ weaving, and Indian /madras/ cloth are also often in tartan
patterns, distinct from the Scottish style.


    Etymology and terminology[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
    index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=1>]

The English <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language> and Scots
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language> word /tartan/ is possibly
derived from French <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language> /
tiretaine/ meaning 'linsey-woolsey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Linsey-woolsey> cloth'.^[2] <#cite_note-Harper-2> ^[3] <#cite_note-
BdLC_57-3> ^[4] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_3-4> Other hypotheses are that
it derives from Scottish Gaelic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Gaelic> /tarsainn/ or /tarsuinn/, meaning 'across' or 'crossing
over';^[3] <#cite_note-BdLC_57-3> ^[4] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_3-4> or
from French /tartarin/ or /tartaryn/ (occurring in 1454 spelled /
tartyn/)^[5] <#cite_note-DOST-5> meaning 'Tartar cloth <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mongol_elements_in_Western_medieval_art#Mongol_Empire_%22Tatar%22_textiles_in_medieval_art>'.^[2] <#cite_note-Harper-2> It is unrelated to the superficially similar word /tarlatan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarlatan>/, which refers to a very open-weave muslin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin> similar to cheesecloth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecloth>. /Tartan/ is both a mass noun <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_noun> ("12 metres of tartan") and a count noun <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_noun> ("12 different tartans").

Today, /tartan/ refers to coloured patterns, though originally did not
have to be made up of a pattern at all, as it referred to the type of
weave; as late as the 1820s, some tartan cloth was described as "plain
coloured ... without pattern".^[6] <#cite_note-6> ^[7] <#cite_note-
Scarlett2008-7> Patterned cloth from the Gaelic <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic>-speaking Scottish Highlands
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands> was called /breacan/,
meaning 'many colours'. Over time, the meanings of /tartan/ and /
breacan/ were combined to describe a certain type of pattern on a
certain type of cloth.^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>

The pattern of a particular tartan is called its /sett/. The sett is
made up of a series of lines at specific widths which cross at right
angles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_angle> and blend into each
other;^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> the longer term /setting/ is
occasionally used.^[8] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> /Sett/
can refer to either the minimal visual presentation of the complete
tartan pattern or to a textual representation of it (in a /thread
count/).^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>

Today /tartan/ is used more generally to describe the pattern, not
limited to textiles, appearing on media such as paper, plastics,
packaging, and wall coverings.^[9] <#cite_note-9> ^[7] <#cite_note-
Scarlett2008-7> ^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> ^[10] <#cite_note-10>

In North America, the term /plaid/ is commonly used to refer to
tartan.^[11] <#cite_note-11> ^[12] <#cite_note-STM_faq-12> ^[13]
<#cite_note-13> ^[a] <#cite_note-16> /Plaid/, derived from the Scottish
Gaelic /plaide/ meaning 'blanket',^[16] <#cite_note-17> ^[b]
<#cite_note-20> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes
made up of tartan,^[c] <#cite_note-22> which could be worn several ways:
the belted plaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_plaid> (/breacan
féile/) or "great kilt" which preceded the modern kilt <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt>; the arisaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Arisaid> (/earasaid/), a large shawl that could be wrapped into a dress;
and several types of shoulder cape, such as the full plaid <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_plaid> and fly plaid <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_plaid>. In time, /plaid/ was used to describe
blankets themselves.^[12] <#cite_note-STM_faq-12> In former times, the
term /plaiding/^[20] <#cite_note-Mackay_94-23> or /pladding/^[21]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_40-24> was sometimes used to refer to
tartan cloth. ^[22] <#cite_note-25>


    Weaving and design[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=2>]


      Weaving construction[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=3>]

threads then over two of the warp threads <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/File:K%C3%B6pergewebe_2x2.jpg>Visualisation of 2/2 twill weave: the
black weft threads go two over then two under the orange warp threads,
staggered by one thread each pass (resulting in a diagonal pattern). In
the actual cloth, the white gaps would be closed.

The Scottish Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> provides the following summary definition
of tartan:^[23] <#cite_note-SRT_FAQ-26>

    Tartan (the design) is a pattern that comprises two or more
    different solid-coloured stripes that can be of similar but are
    usually of differing proportions that repeat in a defined sequence.
    The sequence of the warp colours (long-ways threads) is repeated in
    same order and size in the weft (cross-ways threads). The majority
    of such patterns (or setts) are symmetrical, i.e. the pattern
    repeats in the same colour order and proportions in every direction
    from the two pivot points. In the less common asymmetric patterns,
    the colour sequence repeats in blocks as opposed to around
    alternating pivots but the size and colour sequence of warp and weft
    remain the same.

File:Tartan_cloth_closeup.jpg>Close-up view of traditional tartan cloth,
showing pattern of diagonal "ribs" of colour; this is a five-colour
tartan, in scarlet red, black, yellow, azure blue, and crimson red.

In more detail, traditional tartan cloth is a tight, staggered 2/2 twill
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twill> weave of worsted <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worsted> wool: the horizontal /weft <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft>/ (also /woof/ or /fill/) is woven
in a simple arrangement of two-over-two-under the fixed, vertical /warp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft>/, advancing one thread at
each pass.^[15] <#cite_note-Black_3-15> As each thread in the weft
crosses threads in the warp, the staggering by one means that each warp
thread will also cross two weft threads. The result, when the material
is examined closely, is a characteristic 45-degree diagonal pattern of
"ribs" where different colours cross.^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>
^[24] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_55-27> Where a thread in the weft crosses
threads of the same colour in the warp, this produces a solid colour on
the tartan, while a weft thread crossing warp threads of a different
colour produces an equal admixture of the two colours alternating,
producing the appearance of a third colour – a halftone /blend/ or /
mixture/ – when viewed from further back.^[25] <#cite_note-BdLC_61-28>
^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> ^[23] <#cite_note-SRT_FAQ-26> (The
effect is similar to multicolour halftone <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Halftone> printing, or cross-hatching <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cross-hatching> in coloured-pencil art.)^[7] <#cite_note-
Scarlett2008-7> Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different
colours including one blend, increasing quadratically <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_growth> with the number of base colours;
so a set of six base colours produces fifteen blends and a total of
twenty-one different perceived colours.^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>
^[26] <#cite_note-29> ^[d] <#cite_note-30> This means that the more
stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's
pattern becomes.^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> ^[25] <#cite_note-
BdLC_61-28> Unlike in simple /checker (chequer) <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_(pattern)>/ or /dicing/ patterns (like a
chessboard), no solid colour in a tartan appears next to another solid
colour, only a blend^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> (solid colours may
touch at their corners).^[27] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_23-31>

James D. Scarlett (2008) offered a definition of a usual tartan pattern
(some types of tartan deviate from the particulars of this definition –
see below):^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>

    The unit of tartan pattern, the /sett/, is a square, composed of a
    number of rectangles, square and oblong, arranged symmetrically
    around a central square. Each of these elements occurs four times,
    at intervals of ninety degrees, and each is rotated ninety degrees
    in relation to its fellows. The proportions of the elements are
    determined by the relative widths of the stripes that form them.

The sequence of thread colours in the /sett/ (the minimal design of the
tartan, to be duplicated^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>  – "the DNA of
a tartan"),^[28] <#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> starts at an edge and
either reverses or (rarely) repeats on what are called /pivot points/
or /pivots/.^[29] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_62-33> In diagram A, the sett
begins at the first pivot, reverses at the second pivot, continues, then
reverses again at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner
horizontally. In diagram B, the sett proceeds in the same way as in the
warp but vertically. The diagrams illustrate the construction of a
typical /symmetric/^[30] <#cite_note-34> (also /symmetrical/,^[28]
<#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> /reflective/,^[28] <#cite_note-
SRT_threadcount-32> /reversing/,^[31] <#cite_note-35> or /
mirroring/)^[32] <#cite_note-36> ^[e] <#cite_note-38> tartan. However,
on a rare /asymmetric/^[34] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_wedding-39> (/
asymmetrical/,^[28] <#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> or /non-
reversing/)^[34] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_wedding-39> ^[f]
<#cite_note-40> tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just
repeats at them.^[g] <#cite_note-42> An old term for the latter type
is /cheek/ or /cheeck/ pattern.^[36] <#cite_note-43> Also, some tartans
(very few among traditional Scottish tartans) do not have exactly the
same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have
differing thread counts (see below).^[h] <#cite_note-ExMacMillan-45>
Asymmetric and differing-warp-and-weft patterns are more common in
madras cloth (see § Indian madras <#Indian_madras>, below) and some
other weaving traditions than in Scottish tartan.

A tartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear
in the sett.^[i] <#cite_note-51> The /thread count <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_textile_measurement#In_tartans>/ (or /
threadcount/, /thread-count/) not only describes the width of the
stripes on a sett, but also the colours used (typically
abbreviated).^[28] <#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> Usually every number
in a thread count is an even number^[43] <#cite_note-52> to assist in
manufacture. The first and last threads of the thread count are the
pivots.^[29] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_62-33> A thread count combined
with exact colour information and other weaving details is referred to
as a /ticket stamp/^[44] <#cite_note-Blakely_13-53> or simply /
ticket/.^[45] <#cite_note-54>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Tartan_Weaving_in_Lochcarron.jpg>Tartan weaving in Lochcarron
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochcarron>, Scottish Highlands <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands>

There is no universally standardised way to write a thread count,^[38]
<#cite_note-STA_threadcount-46> but the different systems are easy to
distinguish. As a simple example:

  * The thread count "/K4 R24 K24 Y4/" corresponds to a mirroring
    pattern of 4 black threads, 24 red threads, 24 black threads, 4
    yellow threads, in which the beginning black and ending yellow
    pivots are /not/ repeated (after Y4/, the colours are reversed,
    first K24 then R24); this is a "/full-count/ at the pivots" thread
    count.^[29] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_62-33>
      o An equivalent notation is boldfacing the pivot abbreviations:
        *K*4 R24 K24 *Y*4.
  * The same tartan could also be represented as "K/2 R24 K24 Y/2", in
    markup that indicates that the leading black and trailing yellow /
    are/ duplicated before continuing from these pivot points (after Y/
    2, the colours are reversed as Y/2 again, then K24, then R24); this
    is a "/half-count/ at the pivots" thread count.^[28] <#cite_note-
    SRT_threadcount-32>
  * In the older and potentially ambiguous style of thread-counting,
    without the "/" (or bold) notation, a thread count like "K4 R24 K24
    Y4" is assumed to be full-count at the pivots, unless the author
    clearly indicates otherwise.^[29] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_62-33>
    ^[38] <#cite_note-STA_threadcount-46> ^[j] <#cite_note-55> 

In all of these cases, the result is a /half-sett/ thread count, which
represents the threading before the pattern mirrors and completes; a
full-sett thread count for a mirroring (symmetric) tartan is
redundant.^[38] <#cite_note-STA_threadcount-46> A "/" can also be used
between two colour codes (e.g. "W/Y24" for "white/yellow 24") to create
even more of a shorthand threadcount for simple tartans in which half of
the half-sett pattern is different from the other only in the way of a
colour swap;^[46] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_63-56> but this is not a
common style of thread-counting.

  * An asymmetric tartan, one that does not mirror, would be represented
    in a /full-sett/ thread count with "..." markup, as "...K4 R24 K24
    Y4..." (after Y4, the entire pattern would begin again from
    K4).^[28] <#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> 

Various writers and tartan databases do not use a consistent set of
colour names (see § Colour, palettes, and meaning
<#Colour,_palettes,_and_meaning>, below) and abbreviations,^[47]
<#cite_note-57> so a thread count may not be universally understandable
without a colour key/legend <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Chart#Features>. Some recorders prefer to begin a thread count at the
pivot with the colour name (or abbreviation) that is first in
alphabetical order (e.g. if there is a white pivot and a blue one, begin
with blue),^[28] <#cite_note-SRT_threadcount-32> but this is actually
arbitrary.

Though thread counts are quite specific, they can be modified depending
on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan
(e.g., 6 inches square – a typical size for kilts)^[28] <#cite_note-
SRT_threadcount-32> may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necktie>. In this case, the thread count
would be reduced /in proportion/ (e.g. to 3 inches to a side).^[38]
<#cite_note-STA_threadcount-46> In some works, a thread count is reduced
to the smallest even number of threads (often down to 2) required to
accurately reproduce the design;^[29] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_62-33> in
such a case, it is often necessary to up-scale the thread count
proportionally for typical use in kilts and plaids.

Before the 19th century, tartan was often woven with thread for the weft
that was up to 1/3 thicker than the fine thread used for the warp,^[7]
<#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> which would result in a rectangular rather
than square pattern; the solution was to adjust the weft thread count to
return the pattern to square,^[24] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_55-27> or
make it non-square on purpose, as is still done in a handful of
traditional tartans.^[h] <#cite_note-ExMacMillan-45> Uneven warp-and-
weft thread thickness could also contribute to a striped rather than
checked appearance in some tartan samples.^[48] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_88-58>

The predominant colours of a tartan (the widest bands) are called the /
under-check/ (or /under check/, /undercheck/, /under-cheque/);^[49]
<#cite_note-59> sometimes the terms /ground/,^[k] <#cite_note-61> /
background/,^[51] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_47-62> or /base/^[51]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_47-62> are used instead, especially if there is
only one dominant colour. Thin, contrasting lines are referred to as
the /over-check/^[52] <#cite_note-63> ^[51] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_47-62> (also /over-stripe/ or /overstripe/).^[53]
<#cite_note-64> Over-checks in pairs are sometimes referred to as /tram
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram> lines/, /tramlines/, or /tram
tracks/.^[54] <#cite_note-SRT_tram,_guard-65> Bright over-checks are
sometimes bordered on either side (usually both), for extra contrast, by
additional thin lines, often black, called /guard lines/ or /
guards/.^[54] <#cite_note-SRT_tram,_guard-65> Historically, the weaver
William Wilson & Son of Bannockburn sometimes wove bright over-checks in
silk, to give some added shine^[55] <#cite_note-66> ^[56]
<#cite_note-67> (commercially around 1820–30, but in regimental
officers' plaids back to at least 1794).^[57] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2012-01-68> ^[l] <#cite_note-69> Tartan used for plaids
(not the belted plaid) often have a purled <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Knitting#Knit_(or_plain)_and_purl_stitches> fringe.^[58]

An old-time practice, to the 18th century, was to add an accent on
plaids or sometimes kilts in the form of a /selvedge <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selvedge>/ in herringbone weave <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herringbone_(cloth)> at the edge, 1–3 inches (2.5–
7.6 cm) wide, but still fitting into the colour pattern of the
sett;^[58] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2019-70> ^[59] <#cite_note-71> a
few modern weavers will still produce some tartan in this style.
Sometimes more decorative selvedges were used: /Selvedge marks/ were
borders (usually on one side only) formed by repeating a colour from the
sett in a broad band (often in herringbone), sometimes further bordered
by a thin strip of another colour from the sett or decorated in mid-
selvedge with two thin strips; these were typically used for the bottoms
of belted plaids and kilts,^[58] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2019-70>
^[60] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2020-04-72> and were usually black in
military tartans, but could be more colourful in civilian ones.^[61]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_18-73> The more elaborate /selvedge
patterns/ were a wider series of narrow stripes using some or all of the
colours of the sett; these were almost exclusively used on household
tartans (blankets, curtains, etc.), and on two opposing sides of the
fabric.^[61] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_18-73> ^[58] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2019-70> The very rare /total border/ is an all-four-sides
selvedge of a completely different sett; described by Peter Eslea
MacDonald (2019) as "an extraordinarily difficult feature to weave and
can be regarded as the zenith of the tartan weaver's art",^[58]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2019-70> it only survives in Scottish-style
tartan as a handful of 18th-century samples (in Scotland^[62]
<#cite_note-74> and Nova Scotia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nova_Scotia>, Canada, but probably all originally from Scotland).^[63]
<#cite_note-75> The style has also been used in Estonia in the weaving
of /suurrätt/ shawls/plaids <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Tartan is usually woven /balanced-warp/ (or just /balanced/), repeating
evenly from a pivot point at the centre outwards and with a complete
sett finishing at the outer selvedge;^[8] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> ^[64] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2016-01-76>
^[65] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2014-11-77> e.g. a piece of tartan for
a plaid might be 24 setts long and 4 wide. An /offset/, /off-set/, or /
unbalanced/ weave is one in which the pattern finishes at the edge in
the middle of a pivot colour; this was typically done with pieces
intended to be joined (e.g. for a belted plaid or a blanket) to make
larger spans of cloth with the pattern continuing across the seam;^[8]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> ^[65] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2014-11-77> if the tartan had a selvedge mark or selvedge
pattern, it was at the other side of the warp.^[66] <#cite_note-78>

The term /hard tartan/ refers to a version of the cloth woven with very
tightly wound, non-fuzzy thread, producing a comparatively rougher and
denser (though also thinner) material than is now typical for
kilts.^[67] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_42-79> ^[68] <#cite_note-
SRT_Jacobite,_Old-80> It was in common use up until the 1830s.^[48]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_88-58> There are extant but uncommon
samples of hard tartan from the early 18th century that use the more
intricate herringbone instead of twill weave throughout the entire
cloth.^[69] <#cite_note-81>

While modern tartan is primarily a commercial enterprise on large power
looms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_loom>, tartan was originally
the product of rural weavers of the pre-industrial age, and can be
produced by a dedicated hobbyist with a strong, stable hand loom
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_loom>.^[70] <#cite_note-82> ^[71]
<#cite_note-83> ^[72] <#cite_note-84> Since around 1808, the traditional
size of the warp reed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_(weaving)> for
tartan is 37 inches (94 cm), the length of the Scottish ell <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell> (previous sizes were sometimes 34 and 40
inches).^[73] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_146-147-85> Telfer Dunbar
(1979) describes the setup thus:^[73] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_146-147-85>

    The reed varies in thickness according to the texture of the
    material to be woven. A thirty-Porter (which contains 20 splits of
    the reed) or 600-reed, is divided into 600 openings in the breadth
    of 37 inches. Twenty of these openings are called a Porter and into
    each opening are put two threads, making 1,200 threads of warp and
    as many of weft in a square yard of tartan through a 30-Porter reed.

/Splits/ are also referred to as /dents/, and /Porters/ are also
called /gangs/.^[74] <#cite_note-86>


      Styles and design principles[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=4>]

Traditional tartan patterns can be divided into several style classes.
The most basic is a simple two-colour check of thick bands (with or
without thin over-checks of one or more other colours). A variant on
this splits one or more of the bands, to form squares of smaller squares
instead of just big, solid squares; a style heavily favoured in /
Vestiarium Scoticum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vestiarium_Scoticum>/. A complexity step up is the superimposed check,
in which a third colour is placed centrally "on top of" or
"inside" (surrounded by) one of the base under-check colours, providing
a pattern of nested squares, which might then also have thin, bright
and/or black over-checks added. Another group is multiple checks,
typically of two broad bands of colour on a single dominant
"background" (e.g. red, blue, red, green, red – again possibly with
contrasting narrow over-checks). The aforementioned types can be
combined into more complex tartans. In any of these styles, an over-
check is sometimes not a new colour but one of the under-check colours
"on top of" the other under-check. A rare style, traditionally used for
arisaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arisaid> (/earasaid/) tartans but
no longer in much if any Scottish use, is a pattern consisting entirely
of thin over-checks, sometimes grouped, "on" a single ground colour,
usually white.^[75] <#cite_note-87> M. Martin (1703) reported that the
line colours were typically blue, black, and red.^[76] <#cite_note-88>
Examples of this style do not survive,^[77] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_40-89> at least not in the tartan databases (there may be
preserved museum pieces with such patterns).^[m] <#cite_note-91> Some
tartan patterns are more abstract and do not fit into any of these
styles,^[79] <#cite_note-92> especially in madras cloth (see § Indian
madras <#Indian_madras>, below).

There are no codified rules or principles of tartan design, but a few
writers have offered some considered opinions. Banks & de La Chapelle
(2007) summarized, with a view to broad, general tartan use, including
for fashion: "Color – and how it is worked – is pivotal to tartan
design.... Thus, tartans should be composed of clear, bright colors, but
ones sufficiently soft to blend well and thereby create new shades."
James D. Scarlett (2008) noted: "the more colours to begin with, the
more subdued the final effect",^[51] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_47-62> or
put more precisely, "the more stripes to the sett and the more colours
used, the more diffuse and 'blurred' the pattern".^[7] <#cite_note-
Scarlett2008-7> That does not necessarily translate into subtlety; a
tartan of many colours and stripes can seem "busy".^[80] <#cite_note-93>

Scarlett (2008), after extensive research into historical Highland
patterns (which were dominated by rich red and medium green in about
equal weight with dark blue as a blending accent – not accounting for
common black lines), suggested that for a balanced and /traditional/
style:^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>

    any basic tartan type of design should have for its background, a
    "high impact" colour and two others, of which one should be the
    complement <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_colors> to
    the first and the other a darker and more neutral shade; other
    colours, introduced to break up the pattern or as accents, should be
    a matter of taste. It is important that no colour should be so
    strong as to "swamp" another; otherwise, the blending of colours at
    the crossing will be adversely affected. ... Tartan is a complex
    abstract art-form with a strong mathematical undertone, far removed
    from a simple check with a few lines of contrasting colours
    scattered over it.

Scarlett (1990) provided a more general explanation, traditional styles
aside:^[81] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_45-94>

    Colours for tartan work require to be clear and unambiguous and
    bright but soft, to give good contrast of both colour and brightness
    and to mix well so as to give distinctly new shades where two
    colours cross without any one swamping another.

Further, Scarlett (1990) held that "background checks will show a firm
but not harsh contrast and the overchecks will be such as to show
clearly" on the under-check (or "background") colours.^[51] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_47-62> He summed up the desired total result as "a
harmonious blend of colour and pattern worthy to be looked upon as an
art form in its own right".^[82] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_7-95>

Omitting traditional black lines has a strong softening effect, as in
the 1970s Missoni fashion ensemble (top right) and in many madras
patterns (see § Indian madras <#Indian_madras>, below). A Scottish
black-less design (now the Mar <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Mar>
dress tartan) dates to the 18th century;^[83] <#cite_note-SRT_Mar-96>
another is Ruthven (1842, above), and many of the Ross tartans (e.g.
1886, above), as well as several of the Victorian–Edwardian MacDougal[l]
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacDougall> designs,^[84]
<#cite_note-SRT_MacDougal-97> are further examples. Various modern
tartans also use this effect, e.g. Canadian Maple Leaf (1964, at
§ Regional <#Regional>, below). Clever use of black or another dark
colour can produce a visual perception <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Optical_illusion> of depth.^[85] <#cite_note-98>


      Colour, palettes, and meaning[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=5>]

There is no set of exact colour standards for tartan hues; thread colour
varies from weaver to weaver even for "the same" colour.^[86]
<#cite_note-99> A certain range of general colours, however, are
traditional in Scottish tartan. These include blue (dark), crimson (rose
or dark red), green (medium-dark), black, grey (medium-dark), purple,
red (scarlet or bright), tan/brown, white (actually natural undyed wool,
called /lachdann/ in Gaelic),^[87] <#cite_note-100> ^[n]
<#cite_note-103> and yellow.^[46] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_63-56> ^[7]
<#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> ^[o] <#cite_note-104> Some additional
colours that have been used more rarely are azure (light or sky blue),
maroon, and vert (bright or grass green),^[46] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_63-56> plus light grey (as seen in Balmoral tartan, though
it is sometimes given as lavender).^[90] <#cite_note-105> Since the
opening of the tartan databases to registration of newly designed
tartans, including many for organisational and fashion purposes, a wider
range of colours have been involved, such as orange^[91]
<#cite_note-106> and pink,^[92] <#cite_note-SRT_Hello_Kitty-107> which
were not often used (as distinct colours rather than as renditions of
red) in old traditional tartans.^[p] <#cite_note-108> The Scottish
Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> uses a long list of colours keyed to
hexadecimal "Web colours <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colours>",
sorting groups of hues into a constrained set of basic codes (but
expanded upon the above traditional list, with additional options like
dark orange, dark yellow, light purple, etc.).^[93] <#cite_note-109>
This helps designers fit their creative tartan into a coding scheme
while allowing weavers to produce an approximation of that design from
readily stocked yarn supplies.

began to be replaced by artificial dyes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Aniline#Synthetic_dye_industry>, which were easier to use and were more
economic for the booming tartan industry,^[96] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_222-224-113> though also less subtle.^[97] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_9-114> Although William Morris <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris> in the late-19th-century Arts and
Crafts movement <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement>
tried to revive use of British natural dyes, most were so low-yield and
so inconsistent from locality to locality (part of the reason for the
historical tartan differentiation by area) that they proved to have
little mass-production potential, despite some purple dye (cudbear
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudbear>) commercialisation efforts in
Glasgow in the 18th century.^[96] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_222-224-113> The hard-wound, fine wool used in tartan
weaving was rather resistant to natural dyes, and some dye baths
required days or even weeks.^[96] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_222-224-113> The dyeing also required mordants
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant> to fix the colours permanently,
usually metallic salts like alum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alum>;
there are records from 1491 of alum being imported to Leith <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leith>, though not necessarily all for tartan
production in particular.^[98] <#cite_note-115> Some colours of dye were
usually imported, especially red cochineal and to some extent blue
indigo (both expensive and used to deepen native dyes), from the Low
Countries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries>, with which
Scotland had extensive trade since the 15th century.^[99]
<#cite_note-116> Aged human urine (called /fual/ or /graith/) was also
used, as a colour-deepener, a dye solubility <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Solubility> agent, a lichen fermenter <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Ferment>, and a final colour-fastness treatment.^[100]
<#cite_note-117> All commercially manufactured tartan today is coloured
using artificial not natural dyes, even in the less saturated colour
palettes.^[101] <#cite_note-118> ^[102] <#cite_note-Thompson_color-119>

The hues of colours in any established tartan can be altered to produce
variations of the same tartan. Such varying of the hues to taste dates
to at least the 1788 pattern book of manufacturer William Wilson & Son
of Bannockburn.^[103] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_145-120> Today, the
semi-standardised colour schemes or /palettes/ (what marketers might
call "colourways <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/colourway>")^[104]
<#cite_note-121> are divided generally into /modern/, /ancient/, /
muted/, and /weathered/ (sometimes with other names, depending on
weaver). These terms only refer to relative dye <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dye> "colourfulness" saturation <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness> levels and do not represent distinct
tartans.^[105] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_colour-122> ^[106]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123>

Modern
    Also known as /ordinary/; refers to darker tartan, with fully
    saturated colours.^[102] <#cite_note-Thompson_color-119> ^[106]
    <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123> In a /modern/ palette, setts made up
    of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured because of the
    darkness of the colours in this scheme.^[102] <#cite_note-
    Thompson_color-119> 
Ancient
    Also known as /old colours/ (OC); refers to a lighter palette of
    tartan. These hues are ostensibly meant to represent the colours
    that would result from natural-dyed fabric aging over time. However,
    the results are not accurate (e.g., in real examples of very old
    tartan, black often fades toward khaki^[102] <#cite_note-
    Thompson_color-119> or green^[107] <#cite_note-124> while blue
    remains dark;^[102] <#cite_note-Thompson_color-119> and natural dyes
    are capable of producing some very vibrant colours in the first
    place, though not very consistently).^[106] <#cite_note-
    Newsome_2006-123> ^[81] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_45-94> ^[108]
    <#cite_note-125> This style originated in the first half of the 20th
    century.^[109] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_43-126> ^[106] <#cite_note-
    Newsome_2006-123> This /ancient/ is not to be confused with the same
    word in a few names of tartans such as "ancient Campbell".
Weathered
    Also called /faded/; refers to tartan that is even lighter (less
    saturated) than /ancient/, as if exposed for a very long time.^[106]
    <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123> This style was invented in the late
    1940s.^[109] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_43-126> 
Muted
    Refers to tartan which is between /modern/ and /ancient/ in
    vibrancy. Although this type of colouring is very recent, dating
    only from the early 1970s, these hues are thought to be the closest
    match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the
    mid-19th century.^[106] <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123> 

Some particular tartan mills have introduced other colour schemes that
are unique to that weaver and only available in certain tartans. Two
examples are Lochcarron's /antique/,^[106] <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123>
between /modern/ and /ancient/; and D. C. Dalgliesh's /reproduction/, a
slight variation on /weathered/,^[105] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_colour-122> dating to the 1940s and claimed to be based
on 18th-century samples.^[110] <#cite_note-127>

A general observation about /ancient/old/, /weathered/faded/, and /
muted/ are that they rather uniformly reduce the saturation of all
colours, while actual natural-dyed tartan samples show that the
historical practice was usually to pair one or more saturated colours
with one or more pale ones, for greater clarity and depth, a "harmonious
balance".^[111] <#cite_note-128> ^[106] <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123>
^[105] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_colour-122> According to Scarlett
(1990): "The colours were clear, bright and soft, altogether unlike the
eye-searing brilliance or washed-out dullness of modern tartans".^[82]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_7-95>

The same tartan in the same palette from two manufacturers (e.g.
Colquhoun <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Colquhoun> muted from
D. C. Dalgliesh and from Strathmore) will not precisely match; there is
considerable artistic license involved in exactly how saturated to make
a hue.^[102] <#cite_note-Thompson_color-119>

Tartan-generation software can approximate the appearance of a tartan in
any of these palettes. The examples below are all the "Prince Charles
Edward Stuart" tartan:^[112] <#cite_note-SRT_PCES-129>

Scottish tartans that use two or more hues of the same basic colour are
fairly rare. The best known is the British royal family's Balmoral^[113]
<#cite_note-130> (1853, two greys, both as under-check – see
illustration at § Family and individual <#Family_and_individual>,
below). Others include: Akins <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Akins>^[114] <#cite_note-131> (1850, two reds, one as over-check and
sometimes rendered purple), MacBean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_MacBean>^[115] <#cite_note-SRT_MacBean-132> (1872, two reds, one as
over-check and sometimes rendered purple), Childers Universal
regimental^[116] <#cite_note-133> (1907, two greens, both under-check),
Gordon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon> red^[117]
<#cite_note-134> (recorded 1930–1950 but probably considerably older;
two blues and two reds, one of each used more or less as over-checks),
Galloway <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galloway> district hunting/
green^[118] <#cite_note-135> ^[119] <#cite_note-136> (1939/1950s, two
greens, both under-check), US Air Force Reserve <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Reserve_Command> Pipe Band^[120]
<#cite_note-137> (1988, two blues, both under-check), McCandlish
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCandlish>^[121] <#cite_note-138> ^[122]
<#cite_note-139> ^[123] <#cite_note-140> (1992, three variants, all
under-check), Isle of Skye <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Skye>
district^[124] <#cite_note-141> (1992, three greens, all arguably under-
check, nested within each other), and Chisholm <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisholm_(surname)> Colonial^[125]
<#cite_note-142> (2008, two blues, one an over-check, the other nearly
blended into green). The practice is more common in very recent
commercial tartans that have no association with Scottish families or
districts, such as the Loverboy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Charles_Jeffrey_(fashion_designer)> fashion label tartan^[126]
<#cite_note-SRT_Loverboy-143> (2018, three blues, one an over-check).

The idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning
is purely a modern one,^[127] <#cite_note-144> notwithstanding a legend
that red tartans were "battle tartans", designed so they would not show
blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian provincial
and territorial tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Regional_tartans_of_Canada> (beginning 1950s) and US state tartans
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_tartans> (beginning
1980s), that are stated to be designed with certain symbolic meaning for
the colours used. For example, green sometimes represents prairies
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie> or forests, blue can represent
lakes and rivers, and yellow might stand for various crops.^[128]
<#cite_note-MacDonald1995_48-145> In the /Scottish Register of Tartans/
(and the databases before it), colour inspiration notes are often
recorded by a tartan's designer. However, there is no common set of
tartan colour or pattern "motifs" with allusive <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allusion> meanings that is shared among
designers.^[r] <#cite_note-148>

More abstractly, from an art criticism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Art_criticism> perspective, design historian Richard Martin <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Martin_(curator)> (1988) wrote of tartans
as designs and tartan as a textile class having no truly endemic or
objectified meanings, but being an art that "has the property of being a
vessel or container of meaning, a design form that exists not only in
history but through history", capable of conveying radically different,
even contradictory, contextual meanings "ever changing and evolving"
through socio-cultural transmutation of the fabric's use. Thus tartan
could veer from symbol of anti-union and Jacobite Highland rebellion to
emblem of pan-British loyalty to empire in the space of two generations,
or serve different fashion markets in the same recent decades as both a
sartorial status symbol of traditional values and a punk and grunge
rebel banner.^[131] <#cite_note-149>


    Early history[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=6>]


      Pre-medieval origins[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=7>]

Classical Roman writers made various references to the continental Gauls
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauls>, south of Britain, wearing striped
or variegated clothing; Latin seems to have lacked an exact word for
'checked'. For example, Virgil <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil> in
the Aeneid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid> (29–19 BC, book VIII,
line 660) described the Gauls as /virgatis lucent sagulis/ (or /
sagalis/) meaning something like 'they shine in striped cloaks' or
'their cloaks are striped brightly'.^[132] <#cite_note-
Thompson1992_iv-150> ^[133] <#cite_note-151> ^[134] <#cite_note-
Adam_385-152> Other writers used words such as /pictae/ and /virgatae/
^[135] <#cite_note-StewartDW_Cody-153> with translations like 'marled',
'variegated', 'particoloured', etc. Scarlett (1990) warns: "What is not
reasonable is the ready assumption by many modern authors that every
time one of these words, or something like it, was used, tartan was
intended."^[136] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_10-154> It might have been
intended sometimes, or the writer might have just meant linear stripes
like seersucker <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seersucker> cloth. Both
Scarlett and Thompson (1992) decry the unsustainable assumption by a few
earlier modern writers (e.g. James Grant, 1886) that Gauls must have
been running around in clan tartans.^[136] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_10-154> ^[132] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150> The Romans
particularly wrote of Gauls as wearing striped /braccae <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braccae>/ (trousers). E. G. Cody in remarks in his
1885 edition of John Lesley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
John_Lesley>'s /Historie of Scotland/ hypothesized that this was
actually a Gaulish loanword <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword> and
was cognate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate> with Gaelic /
breacan/.^[135] <#cite_note-StewartDW_Cody-153> This is one of many
"tartan legends" that is not well accepted; rather, /braccae/ is
considered by modern linguists <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Linguistics> a cognate of English /breeches/, Gaelic /briogais/
('trousers'), etc.^[137] <#cite_note-155>

The earliest documented tartan-like cloth in Britain, known as the
"Falkirk tartan",^[138] <#cite_note-156> dates from the 3rd
century AD.^[139] <#cite_note-Chen-157> It was uncovered at Falkirk
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkirk> in Stirlingshire, Scotland, near
the Antonine Wall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Wall>. The
fragment, held in the National Museum of Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Scotland>, was stuffed into the
mouth of an earthenware pot containing almost 2,000 Roman <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain> coins.^[140] <#cite_note-158> The
Falkirk tartan has a simple "Border check" <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Border_tartan> design, of undyed light and dark wool.^[s]
<#cite_note-159> Other evidence from this period is the surviving
fragment of a statue of Roman Emperor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Roman_Empire> Caracalla <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla>, once
part of the triumphal arch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Triumphal_arch> of Volubilis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volubilis>
completed in 217 AD. It depicts a Caledonian <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Caledonia> Pictish <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts> prisoner
wearing tartan trews <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trews> (represented
by carving a checked design then inlaying <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Inlay> it with bronze and silver alloys <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Alloy> to give a variegated appearance).^[141] <#cite_note-160>
^[t] <#cite_note-161> Based on such evidence, tartan researcher James D.
Scarlett (1990) believes Scottish tartan to be "of Pictish or earlier
origin",^[142] <#cite_note-162> though Brown (2012) notes there is no
way to prove or disprove this.^[143] <#cite_note-163>

Early forms of tartan like this are thought to have been invented in
pre-Roman times, and would have been popular among the inhabitants of
the northern Roman provinces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Roman_province>^[144] <#cite_note-164> ^[145] <#cite_note-165> as well
as in other parts of Northern Europe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Northern_Europe> such as Jutland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jutland>, where the same pattern was prevalent,^[146] <#cite_note-166>
^[147] <#cite_note-167> ^[148] <#cite_note-168> and Bronze Age <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age> Sweden <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sweden>.^[149] <#cite_note-169>

That twill <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twill> weave was selected,
even in ancient times, is probably no accident; "plain (2/2) twill for a
given gauge of yarn, yields a cloth 50% heavier [denser] – and hence
more weather-proof – than the simple 1/1 weave <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_weave>."^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>
According to Scarlett (2008):^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>

    [T]here are sound reasons why such a type of pattern-textile should
    have developed almost automatically in isolated, self-sufficient ...
    communities. Such communities are unlikely to possess large dye-
    vats, and so cannot piece-dye woven cloth; such processes as batik
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik> and tie-dye <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-dye> are unavailable. ... Stripes are the
    practical solution, since they use small quantities of a colour at a
    time and are interspersed with other colours, but the scope is
    limited ...; stripes across both brighten the colours and add many
    mixtures. From there on it is really only a matter of getting
    organised; the now-geometric pattern reduces to a small unit, easier
    to remember and to follow in a world where little was written down;
    it is further simplified by being split into two equal halves and,
    with weft as warp, the weft pattern can be followed from the warp.


      Medieval[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=8>]

Fairly crude painting (detail) of a man using some kind of tool, wearing
a cotehardie (tunic) of half red cloth and half complex tartan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plaid_cotehardie.jpg>Detail of Spanish
altarpiece by the "Master of Estamariu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Estamariu>", late 14th century, showing a particoloured cotehardie
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotehardie> with a three-colour, complex
tartan

There is little written or pictorial evidence about tartan (much less
surviving tartan cloth) from the Medieval era <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Middle_Ages>. Tartan use in Britain between the 3rd-century Falkirk
tartan and 16th-century samples, writings, and art is unclear.^[150]
<#cite_note-BdLC_66-68-170> ^[151] <#cite_note-171> Cosmo Innes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo_Innes> (1860) wrote that, according
to medieval hagiographies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagiography>,
Scots of the 7th–8th centuries "used cloaks of variegated colour,
apparently of home manufacture".^[152] <#cite_note-172> Based on
similarities of tartans used by various clans, including the Murrays
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray>, Sutherlands <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Sutherland>, and Gordons <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon>, and the history of their family
interactions over the centuries, Thomas Innes of Learney <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Innes_of_Learney> estimated that a regional
"parent" pattern, of a more general style, might date to the 12th or
13th century,^[153] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_10-173> but this is
quite speculative. The cartularies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cartulary> of Aberdeen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen> in the
13th century barred clergymen from wearing "striped" clothing, which
could have referred to tartan.^[154] <#cite_note-174>

In 1333, Italian Gothic artists <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Gothic_art> Simone Martini <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Simone_Martini> and Lippo Memmi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Lippo_Memmi> produced the /Annunciation with St. Margaret and St.
Ansanus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Annunciation_with_St._Margaret_and_St._Ansanus>/, a wood-panel painting
in tempera <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempera> and gold leaf
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_leaf>. It features the archangel
Gabriel in a tartan-patterned mantle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Simone_Martini_080.jpg>, with light highlights where the darker
stripes meet, perhaps representing jewels, embroidery <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery>, or supplementary weaving <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_weaving>. Art historians consider it
an example of "Tartar" (Mongol) textile influence <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mongol_elements_in_Western_medieval_art#Mongol_Empire_%22Tatar%22_textiles_in_medieval_art>; it likely has no relation to Scottish tartan.^[u] <#cite_note-175> "Tartar" cloth came in a great array of patterns, many more complex than tartan (such as the fine detail in Gabriel's robe in the same painting); patterns of this sort were influential especially on Italian art in the 14th century.

There are several other continental European paintings of tartan-like
garments from around this era (even back to the 13th century), but most
of them show very simple two-colour basic check <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_(pattern)> patterns, or (like the Martini
and Memmi /Annunciation/ example) broad squares made by thin lines of
one colour on a background of another. Any of them could represent
embroidery or patchwork <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patchwork> rather
than woven tartan. There seems to be no indication in surviving records
of tartan material being imported from Scotland in this period. In the
second half of the 14th century, the artist known only as the "Master of
Estamariu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estamariu>" (in Catalonia,
Spain) painted an altarpiece of St Vincent, one of the details of which
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Plaid_cotehardie.jpg> is a man in a
cotehardie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotehardie> that is red on one
half and a complex three-colour tartan on the other, which is very
similar to later-attested Scottish tartans.

Sir Francis James Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Francis_James_Grant>, mid-20th-century Lord Lyon King of Arms <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms>, noted that records showed
the wearing of tartan in Scotland to date as far back as 1440.^[155]
<#cite_note-176> However, it is unclear to which records he was
referring, and other, later researchers have not matched this early date.

The oldest surviving sample of complex, dyed-wool tartan (not just a
simple check pattern) in Scotland has been shown through radiocarbon
dating <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating> to be from the
16th century; known as the "Glen Affric tartan", it was discovered in
the early 1980s in a peat bog <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peat_bog>
near Glen Affric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Affric> in the
Scottish Highlands; its faded colours include green, brown, red, and
yellow. On loan from the Scottish Tartans Authority <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Authority>, the 55 cm × 42 cm
(22 in × 17 in) artefact went on display at the V&A Dundee <https://

The earliest certain written reference to tartan by name is in the 1532–
33 accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland: "Ane uthir tartane galcoit
gevin to the king be the Maister Forbes" ('Another tartan coat given to
the king by the Master Forbes'),^[5] <#cite_note-DOST-5> followed not
long after by a 1538 Scottish Exchequer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Exchequer> accounting of clothing to be ordered for King James V of
Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_V_of_Scotland>, which
referred to "heland tertane to be hoiss" ('Highland tartan to be hose
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hose_(clothing)>').^[159] <#cite_note-
SRT_NRS-181> ^[160] <#cite_note-182> ^[w] <#cite_note-183> Plaids were
featured a bit earlier; poet William Dunbar <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/William_Dunbar> (c. 1459 – c. 1530) mentions "Five thousand ellis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell> ... Of Hieland pladdis".^[161]
<#cite_note-184> The earliest surviving image of a Highlander in what
was probably meant to represent tartan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:%C3%89scossois_sauvage_(Lucas_de_Heere,_c._1567-80).jpg> is a 1567–
80 watercolour <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolour> by Lucas de
Heere <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_de_Heere>, showing a man in a
belted, pleated yellow tunic with a thin-lined checked pattern, a light-
red cloak, and tight blue shorts (of a type also seen in period Irish
art), with claymore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore> and dirk
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk>.^[162] <#cite_note-185> It looks
much like medieval illustrations of "Tartar" cloth and thus cannot be
certain to represent true tartan. By the late 16th century, there are
numerous references to striped or checked plaids. Supposedly, the
earliest pattern that is still produced today (though not in continual
use) is the Lennox district tartan,^[163] <#cite_note-186> (also adopted
as the clan tartan of Lennox <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Lennox>)^[164] <#cite_note-187> said to have been reproduced by
D. W. Stewart in 1893 from a portrait of Margaret Douglas <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Douglas>, Countess of Lennox, dating to
around 1575.^[165] <#cite_note-SCSC_history-188> However, this seems to
be legend, as no modern tartan researchers or art historians have
identified such a portrait, and the earliest known realistic one of a
woman in tartan dates much later, to c. 1700.^[166] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2016-189> Extant portraits of Margaret show her in velvet
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet> and brocade <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brocade>.^[167] <#cite_note-190>

Tartan and Highland dress in the Elizabethan era <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era> have been said to have become
essentially classless <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class>^[x]
<#cite_note-196>  – worn in the Highlands by everyone from high-born
lairds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird> to common crofters
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croft_(land)>,^[173] <#cite_note-
Spinning-197> at least by the late 16th century. The historian John
Major <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major_(philosopher)> wrote in
1521 that it was the upper class, including warriors, who wore plaids
while the common among them wore linen, suggesting that woollen cloth
was something of a luxury.^[174] <#cite_note-198> But by 1578, Bishop
John Lesley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lesley> of Ross wrote
that the belted plaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_plaid> was
the general Highland costume of both rich and poor, with the nobility
simply able to afford larger plaids with more colours.^[171]
<#cite_note-StewartDW_7-194> (Later, Burt (1726) also wrote of gentlemen
having larger plaids than commoners.)^[20] <#cite_note-Mackay_94-23> If
colours conveyed distinction, it was of social class not clan.^[175]
<#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_23-199> D. W. Stewart (1893) attributed the
change, away from linen, to broader manufacture of woollen cloth and
"the increased prosperity of the people".^[171] <#cite_note-
StewartDW_7-194>

Many writers of the period drew parallels between Irish and Highland
dress, especially the wearing of a long yellow-dyed shirt called the /
léine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9ine>/ or saffron shirt
(though probably not actually dyed with expensive imported saffron
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron>),^[176] <#cite_note-200> worn
with a mantle (cloak) over it, and sometimes with trews <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trews>.^[177] <#cite_note-201> It is not entirely
certain when these mantles were first made of tartan in the Highlands,
but the distinctive cloth seems to get its recorded mentions first in
the 16th century, starting with Major (1521). In 1556, Jean de Beaugué
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_Beaugu%C3%A9>, a French witness
of Scottish troops on the continent at the 1548 Siege of Haddington
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Haddington>, distinguished
Lowlanders from Highland "savages", and wrote of the latter as wearing
shirts "and a certain light covering made of wool of various
colours".^[178] <#cite_note-202> ^[179] <#cite_note-Adam_387-203> George
Buchanan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Buchanan> in 1582 wrote
that "plaids of many colours" had a long tradition but that the Highland
fashion by his era had mostly shifted to a plainer look, especially
brown tones, as a practical matter of camouflage.^[180] <#cite_note-204>
^[y] <#cite_note-207> Fynes Moryson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Fynes_Moryson> wrote in 1598 (published 1617) of common Highland women
wearing "plodan", "a course stuffe, of two or three colours in Checker
worke".^[183] <#cite_note-208>

Its dense weave requiring specialised skills and equipment, tartan was
not generally one individual's work but something of an early cottage
industry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putting-
out_system#Cottage_industry> in the Highlands – an often communal
activity called /calanas/, including some associated folk singing
traditions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waulking_song> – with several
related occupational specialties (wool comber, dyer, waulker <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waulking>, warp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Warp_and_weft>-winder, weaver) among people in a village, part-time or
full-time,^[185] <#cite_note-211> especially women.^[186]
<#cite_note-212> ^[aa] <#cite_note-215> The spinning wheel <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_wheel> was a late technological arrival
in the Highlands, and tartan in this era was woven from fine (but fairly
inconsistent) hard-spun yarn that was spun by hand on drop spindles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spindle_(textiles)>.^[7] <#cite_note-
Scarlett2008-7> The era's commerce in tartans was centred on Inverness
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness>, the early business records of
which are filled with many references to tartan goods.^[189]
<#cite_note-216> Tartan patterns were loosely associated with the
weavers of particular areas, owing in part to differences in
availability of natural dyes,^[96] <#cite_note-

Barnes_&_Allen_266-110> ^[191] <#cite_note-218> and it was common for
Highlanders to wear whatever was available to them,^[1] <#cite_note-
Newsome_1994-1> often a number of different tartans at the same
time.^[192] <#cite_note-219> ^[ab] <#cite_note-221> The early tartans
found in east-coastal Scotland used red more often, probably because of
easier continental-European trade in the red dye cochineal <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal>, while western tartans were more often
in blues and greens, owing to the locally available dyes.^[165]
<#cite_note-SCSC_history-188> (See also § Colour, palettes, and meaning
<#Colour,_palettes,_and_meaning>.) The greater expense of red dye may
have also made it a status symbol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Status_symbol>.^[194] <#cite_note-222> Tartan spread at least somewhat
out of the Highlands, but was not universally well received. The General
Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kirk_of_Scotland> in 1575 prohibited the ministers and readers of the
church (and their wives) from wearing tartan plaids and other "sumptuous
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law>" clothing,^[195]
<#cite_note-223> ^[196] <#cite_note-224> while the council of Aberdeen,
"a district by no means Highland", in 1576 banned the wearing of plaids
(probably meaning belted plaids).^[197] <#cite_note-StewartDW_10-11-225>

A 1594 Irish account by Lughaidh Ó Cléirigh <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Lughaidh_%C3%93_Cl%C3%A9irigh> of Scottish gallowglass mercenaries
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallowglass> in Ireland clearly describes
the belted plaid, "a mottled garment with numerous colours hanging in
folds to the calf of the leg, with a girdle round the loins over the
garment".^[198] <#cite_note-226> The privately organised early
"plantations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Plantations_of_Ireland>" (colonies) and later governmental Plantation of
Ulster <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_of_Ulster> brought
tartan weaving to Northern Ireland in the late 16th to early 17th
centuries.^[199] <#cite_note-227> Many of the new settlers were Scots,
and they joined the population already well-established there by
centuries of gallowglass and other immigrants. In 1956, the earliest
surviving piece of Irish tartan cloth was discovered in peaty loam just
outside Dungiven <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungiven> in Northern
Ireland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland>, in the form of
tartan trews <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trews>, along with other
non-tartan clothing items.^[200] <#cite_note-228> It was dubbed the
"Dungiven tartan" or "Ulster tartan".^[201] <#cite_note-229> The sample
was dated using palynology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palynology> to
c. 1590–1650^[202] <#cite_note-Wilton_2019-230> ^[203] <#cite_note-
PatersonMB_182-231> (the soil that surrounded the cloth was saturated
with pollen from Scots pine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_pine>,
a species imported to Ulster from Scotland by plantationers).^[204]
<#cite_note-SmithC-232> ^[19] <#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21>
According to archaeological textile expert Audrey Henshall <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Henshall>, the cloth was probably woven in
County Donegal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Donegal>, Ireland,
but the trews tailored in the Scottish Highlands^[204] <#cite_note-
SmithC-232> ^[205] <#cite_note-Newsome_disguise-233> at some expense,
suggesting someone of rank,^[206] <#cite_note-234> possibly a
gallowglass.^[202] <#cite_note-Wilton_2019-230> Henshall reproduced the
tartan for a 1958 exhibit;^[204] <#cite_note-SmithC-232> ^[19]
<#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> it became popular (and heavily
promoted) as a district tartan for Ulster^[19] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Wilkinson-21> (both in a faded form, like it was found,^[207]
<#cite_note-235> and a bright palette that attempted to reproduce what
it may have originally looked like),^[208] <#cite_note-236> and seems to
have inspired the later creation of more Irish district tartans.^[19]
<#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> ^[209] <#cite_note-
Newsome_rethinking-237> (see § Regional <#Regional>, below). There is
nearly nothing in period source material to suggest that the Irish also
habitually wore tartan; one of the only sources that can possibly be
interpreted in support of the idea is William Camden <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Camden>, who wrote in his /Britannia/
(since at least the 1607 edition) that "Highlandmen ... wear after the
Irish fashion striped mantles".^[210] <#cite_note-StewartDW_15-238>

also by visiting British gentlemen.^[ad] <#cite_note-248> ^[ae]

1621, this time against their use as women's head-wear,^[197]
<#cite_note-StewartDW_10-11-225> and the kirk in Glasgow <https://

Not long after, James Gordon, Parson of Rothiemay <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothiemay>, wrote in /A History of Scots Affairs
from 1637 to 1641/ of the belted plaid as "a loose Cloke of several Ells
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell>, striped and party colour'd, which
they gird breadthwise with a Leathern Belt ...." He also described the
short hose and trews ("trowzes").^[225] <#cite_note-256> A 1653 map, /
Scotia Antiqua/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blaeu_-
_Atlas_of_Scotland_1654_-_SCOTIA_ANTIQUA_-_Old_Scotland.jpg> by Joan
Blaeu <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blaeu>, features a cartouche
that depicts men in trews and belted plaid; the tartan is crudely
represented as just thin lines on a plain background,^[226]
<#cite_note-257> and various existing copies are hand-coloured
differently. Daniel Defoe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe>,
in /Memoirs of a Cavalier/ (c. 1720) wrote, using materials that
probably dated to the English Civil War <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
English_Civil_War>, of Highlanders invading Northern England back in
1639 that they had worn "doublet, breeches and stockings, of a stuff
they called plaid, striped across red and yellow, with short cloaks of
the same".^[227] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_28-29-258>

Besides the formerly often-chastised wearing of head-plaids in church,
women's dress was not often described (except in earlier times as being
similar to men's).^[af] <#cite_note-260> The Highland and island women's
equivalent of the belted plaid was the arisaid <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arisaid> (/earasaid/), a plaid that could be worn
as a large shawl or be wrapped into a dress. Sir William Brereton
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Brereton,_1st_Baronet> had
written in 1634–35 (published 1844) of Lowland women in Edinburgh that:
"Many wear (especially of the meaner sort) plaids ... which is [/sic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic>/] cast over their heads and covers
their faces on both sides, and would reach almost to the ground, but
that they pluck them up, and wear them cast under their arms." He also
reported that women there wore "six or seven several habits and
fashions, some for distinction of widows, wives and maids", including
gowns, capes/cloaks, bonnets with bongrace <https://en.wiktionary.org/
wiki/bongrace> veils, and collar ruffs, though he did not address tartan
patterns in particular in such garments.^[229] <#cite_note-261>

While tartan was still made in the Highlands as cottage industry, by
1655 production had centred on Aberdeen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Aberdeen>, made there "in greater plenty than [in] any other place of
the nation whatsoever",^[21] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_40-24> though
it was also manufactured in Glasgow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Glasgow>, Montrose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Angus>, and
Dundee <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee>, much of it for
export.^[21] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_40-24> In Glasgow at least,
some of the trade was in tartan manufactured in the Highlands and the
Hebrides and brought there for sale along with hides and other
goods.^[21] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_40-24> Impressed by the trade
in Glasgow, Richard Franck <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Richard_Franck_(captain)> in his /Northern Memoirs/ of 1658 wrote that
the cloth was "the staple of this country".^[230] <#cite_note-262> In
1662, the naturalist John Ray <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ray>
wrote of the "party coloured blanket which [Scots] call a plad, over
their heads and shoulders", and commented that a Scotsman even of the
lower class was "clad like a gentleman" because the habit in this time
was to spend extraordinarily on clothing,^[231] <#cite_note-263> a habit
that seems to have gone back to the late 16th century.^[232]
<#cite_note-264> A Thomas Kirk of Yorkshire commented on trews, plaids,
and possibly kilts of "plaid colour" in 1677;^[233] <#cite_note-265>
more material by Kirk was printed in the 1891 /Early Travellers in
Scotland/ edited by Peter Hume Brown <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Peter_Hume_Brown>, recording "plad wear" in the form of belted plaids,
trews, and hose.^[234] <#cite_note-266> A poem by William Cleland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cleland_(poet)> in 1678 had
Scottish officers in trews and shoulder plaids, and soldiers in belted
plaids.^[235] <#cite_note-267> In 1689, Thomas Morer, an English
clergyman to Scottish regiments, described Lowland women as frequently
wearing plaids despite otherwise dressing mostly like the English.^[236]

wrote of the tartan plaids of the women of Mull <https://

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Hebrides> as "much finer, the colours more
lively, and the squares larger than the men's .... This serves them for

      18th century[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=11>]

It is not until early 18th century that regional uniformity in tartan,
sufficient to identify the area of origin, is reported to have
occurred.^[150] <#cite_note-BdLC_66-68-170> Martin Martin <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Martin>, in /A Description of the Western
Islands of Scotland/, published in 1703, wrote, after describing trews
and belted plaids "of divers Colours ... agreeable to the nicest Fancy",
that tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different
places.^[ah] <#cite_note-279> Martin did not mention anything like the
use of a special pattern by each family.

In 1709, the Independent Highland Companies <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Independent_Highland_Companies> were wearing everyday Highland
dress, not uniforms of a particular tartan, to better blend in with
civilians and detect Jacobite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism>
treachery.^[213] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_155-242> In 1713, the
Royal Company of Archers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Royal_Company_of_Archers> (a royal bodyguard unit first formed in
1676),^[246] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012-280> became the first unit
in service to the British crown who adopted a particular tartan as a
part of their formal uniform. The militiamen of Clan Grant <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant> may have been all in green-and-red
tartan (details unspecified) as early as 1703–04^[247] <#cite_note-
StewartDW_26-28-281> ^[165] <#cite_note-SCSC_history-188> and wearing a
uniform tartan livery by 1715.^[248] <#cite_note-Mackay_50-282> It is
not a surviving pattern, and modern Grant tartans are of much later
date.^[249] <#cite_note-283> (For details on early uniform tartans, see
Regimental tartan § Pre-regiment military use <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Regimental_tartan#Pre-regiment_military_use>.)

An account of the Highland men in 1711 had it that they all, including
"those of the better sort", wore the belted plaid.^[250] <#cite_note-
StewartDW_29-284> A 1723 account suggested that gentlemen, at least when
commingling with the English, were more likely to wear tartan trews and
hose with their attendants in the belted plaid,^[250] <#cite_note-
StewartDW_29-284> which Burt also observed;^[251] <#cite_note-285> trews
were also more practical for horseback riding.^[252] <#cite_note-286>
Also around 1723, short tartan jackets, called in Gaelic /còta-goirid/,
sometimes with slashed sleeves and worn with a matching waistcoat, made
their first appearance and began supplanting, in Highland dress, the
plain-coloured doublets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Doublet_(clothing)> that were common throughout European dress of the
era; the /còta-goirid/ was often worn with matching trews and a shoulder
plaid that might or might not match, but could also be worn with a
belted plaid.^[253] <#cite_note-287> ^[ai] <#cite_note-288>

M. Martin (1703) wrote that the "vulgar" Hebridean <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrides> women still wore the arisaid <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arisaid> wrap/dress,^[254] <#cite_note-289>
describing it as "a white Plad, having a few small Stripes of black,
blue, and red; it reach'd from the Neck to the Heels, and was tied
before on the Breast with a Buckle of Silver, or Brass", some very
ornate. He said they also wore a decorated belt, scarlet sleeves, and
head kerchiefs of linen.^[255] <#cite_note-290> Martin was not the only
period source to suggest it was primarily the wear of the common women,
with upper-class Highland ladies in the 18th century more likely to
weartailored gowns, dresses, and riding habits <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_habit>, often of imported material, as did
Lowland and English women.^[166] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189>
^[256] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_39-40-291> Highland women's dress was
also sometimes simply in linear stripes rather than tartan, a cloth
called /iomairt/ (drugget <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Drugget>).^[166] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> From the late 18th
century, as the arisaid was increasingly set aside for contemporary
womenswear, while Highland men continued wearing the belted
plaid.,^[257] <#cite_note-292> the ladies' plaids were reduced to
smaller "screens" – fringed shawls used as headdresses and as dress
accessories,^[256] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_39-40-291> "a gentrification
of the arisaid".^[166] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> (Wilsons
continued producing these in the first half of the 19th century.)^[166]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> John Macky <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Macky> in /A Journey Through Scotland/ (1723)
wrote of Scottish women wearing, when about, such tartan plaids over
their heads and bodies, over English-style dress, and likened the
practice to continental women wearing black wraps for church, market,
and other functions.^[236] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_97-268> Edmund
Burt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burt>, an Englishman who
spent years in and around Inverness, wrote in 1727–1737 (published 1754)
that the women there also wore such plaids, made of fine worsted
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worsted> wool or even of silk <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk>, that they were sometimes used to cover the
head, and that they were worn long, to the ankle, on one side. He added
that in Edinburgh (far to the southeast) they were also worn, with
ladies indicating their Whig <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Whigs_(British_political_party)> or Tory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tories_(British_political_party)> political stance by which side they
wore long (though he did not remember which side was which).^[258]
<#cite_note-293> In Edinburgh, perennial disapproval of the "barbarous
habitte" of women wearing plaids over their heads returned in 1753
writings of William Maitland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
William_Maitland_(historian)>. Women first appear in known painted
portraits with tartan c. 1700, with that of Rachel Gordon of Abergeldie
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abergeldie_Castle>; more early examples
are found in 1742 and 1749 paintings by William Mosman,. They show
plaids (in tartans that do not survive as modern patterns) worn loosely
around the shoulders by sitters in typical European-fashion
dresses.^[259] <#cite_note-294> Some entire dresses of tartan feature in
mid-18th-century portraits, but they are uncommon.^[166] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2016-189> In the Jacobite period, tartan was sometimes
also used as trim, e.g. on hats. Plaids were worn also as part of
wedding outfits. The monied sometimes had entire wedding dresses of
tartan, some in silk, and even devised custom tartans for weddings,
typically based on existing patterns with colours changed.^[256]

Portraits became more popular among the Highland elite starting in the
early 18th century.^[261] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_22-297> Similar cloth

By the early 18th century, tartan manufacture (and weaving in general) were centred in Bannockburn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannockburn>, Stirling; this is where the eventually dominant tartan weaver William Wilson and Son, founded c. 1765, were based.^[264] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_144-300> ^[ak] <#cite_note-302>

Judging from rare surviving samples, the predominant civilian tartan
colours of this period, in addition to white (undyed wool) and black,
were rich reds and greens and rather dark blues, not consistent from
area to area; where a good black was available, dark blue was less
used.^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> The sett of a typical Highland
pattern of the era as shown in portraits was red with broad bands of
green and/or blue, sometimes with fine-line over-checks.^[7]
<#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> ^[al] <#cite_note-303> Oil portraiture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_painting> was the province of the
privileged, and "Sunday best <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Christian_clothing>" tartans with red grounds were commonly worn in them
as a status symbol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_symbol>, from
the early 18th century, the dye typically being made from expensive
imported cochineal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal>.^[166]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> ^[266] <#cite_note-304> Green and
blue more generally predominated owing to their relative ease of
production with locally available dyes, with more difficult yellow^[am]
<#cite_note-306> and red dyes commonly being saved for thin over-check
lines^[268] <#cite_note-307> (a practice that continued, e.g. in
military and consequently many clan tartans, through to the 19th
century – see Regimental tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Regimental_tartans>). However, even local-dyestuff blues were often
over-dyed with some amount of imported indigo <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Indigo> for a richer colour.^[50] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_227-60>


        Union protest and Jacobite rebellion[edit <https://
        en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=12>]

The Treaty <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Union> and Acts of
Union <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707> in 1706–07,
which did away with the separate Parliament of Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Scotland>, led to Scottish
Lowlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands> adopting
tartan in large numbers for the first time, as a symbol of protest
against the union.^[269] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_10-12-308> ^[270]
<#cite_note-BdLC_75-309> It was worn not just by men (regardless of
social class),^[271] <#cite_note-310> but even influential Edinburgh
ladies,^[269] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_10-12-308> ^[272]
<#cite_note-311> well into the 1790s.^[273] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_17-312> By the beginning of the 18th century, there was also
some demand for tartan in England, to be used for curtains, bedding,
nightgowns, etc., and weavers in Norwich <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Norwich>, Norfolk, and some other English cities were attempting to
duplicate Scottish product, but were considered the lower-quality
option.^[250] <#cite_note-StewartDW_29-284>

c. 1750

The most effective fighters for Jacobitism <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Jacobitism> were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an
association of tartan and Highland dress <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Highland_dress> with the Jacobite cause to restore the Catholic Stuart
dynasty <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart> to the throne of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. This included great kilts <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_kilt>, and trews <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Trews> (trousers) with great coats, all typically of tartan cloth,
as well as the blue bonnet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_bonnet>.
The British parliament had considered banning the belted plaid after the
Jacobite rising of 1715 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jacobite_rising_of_1715>, but did not.^[274] <#cite_note-313> Highland
garb came to form something of a Jacobite uniform,^[273] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_17-312> ^[275] <#cite_note-314> even worn by Prince Charles
Edward Stuart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart>
("Bonnie Prince Charlie") himself by the mid-18th century,^[276]
<#cite_note-315> ^[an] <#cite_note-321> mostly in propaganda portraits
(with inconsistent tartans) but also by eyewitness account at Culloden
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden>.^[282]
<#cite_note-322> By this period, sometimes a belted plaid was worn over
tartan trews and jacket (in patterns that need not match).^[283]

An olive-dominated tartan with a fair amount of navy blue and black, and

black), and white <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Culloden_1745_tartan,_centred,_zoomed_out.png>A pattern from a coat
(probably Jacobite) known to date to the period of the 1745 uprising

Burt had concurred c. 1728, as did his 1818 editor Robert Jamieson
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jamieson_(antiquary)>, with
Buchanan's much earlier 1582 observation that tartans were often in
colours intended to blend into heather and other natural
surroundings.^[284] <#cite_note-324> This may just represent prejudices
of English writers of the period, however, at least by the mid-18th
century. Extant samples of Culloden-era cloth are sometimes quite
colourful. One example is a pattern found on a coat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Culloden_1746_tartan,_tiling.png> (probably
Jacobite) known to date to around the 1745 uprising; while it has faded
to olive and navy tones, the sett is a bold one of green, blue, black,
red, yellow, white, and light blue (in diminishing proportions). While
an approximation of the pattern was first published in D. W. Stewart
(1893), the colours and proportions were wrong; the original coat was
rediscovered and re-examined in 2007.^[285] <#cite_note-325> ^[286]
<#cite_note-326> Another surviving Culloden sample, predominantly red
with broad bands of blue, green, and black, and some thin over-check
lines, consists of a largely intact entire plaid that belonged on one
John Moir; it was donated to the National Museum of Scotland in
2019.^[287] <#cite_note-327>

There is a legend that a particular still-extant tartan was used by the
Jacobites as an identifier even prior to "the '15 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_rising_of_1715>". This story can be
traced to W. & A. Smith (1850) in /Authenticated Tartans of the Clans
and Families of Scotland/, in which they claimed that a pattern they
published was received from an unnamed woman then still living who in
turn claimed a family tradition that the tartan dated to 1712, long
before her birth, but for which there is no evidence.^[33] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2022-37> This hearsay tale was later repeated as if known
fact by other books, e.g., Adam Frank's /What Is My Tartan?/ in
1896,^[288] <#cite_note-328> and Margaret MacDougall's 1974 revision of
Robert Bain's 1938 /Clans and Tartans of Scotland/.^[ao]
<#cite_note-331> Even the often credulous Innes of Learney (1938) did
not believe it.^[291] <#cite_note-332> The pattern in question does date
to at least c. 1815–26, because it was collected by the Highland Society
of London <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Society_of_London>
during that span.^[33] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2022-37> But there is
no substantiated evidence of Jacobites using a consistent tartan, much
less one surviving to the present.

Independent Highland Companies were re-raised from clans loyal to the
English crown during 1725–29.^[292] <#cite_note-Cowan_2021-333> ^[ap]
<#cite_note-334> ^[293] <#cite_note-Groves_2-335> This time they wore
uniform tartans of blue, black, and green, presumably with differencing
over-check lines.^[294] <#cite_note-Campbell_of_Airds-336> ^[293]
<#cite_note-Groves_2-335> ^[214] <#cite_note-Newsome_Black_Watch-243>
They were all normalised to one tartan during 1725–33^[214] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Black_Watch-243> ^[216] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_26-27-245>
^[215] <#cite_note-Anderson_1939-244> ^[295] <#cite_note-337> (a pattern
which probably does not survive to the present day).^[165] <#cite_note-
SCSC_history-188> The uniform tartan appears to have changed into a new
tartan, known today as Black Watch or Government, when the companies
amalgamated to become the 42nd (Black Watch) <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/42nd_Regiment_of_Foot> regiment in 1739. (See Regimental tartan

        Proscription and its aftermath[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=13>]

After the failure of the Jacobite rising of 1745 <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_rising_of_1745>, efforts to pacify the
Highlands and destroy the cultural and political life of the clans^[296]
<#cite_note-338> ^[297] <#cite_note-339> led to the Dress Act 1746
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_Act_1746>, part of the Act of
Proscription <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Proscription_1746> to
disarm the Highlanders. Because tartan Highland dress was so strongly
symbolically linked to the militant Jacobite cause,^[298] <#cite_note-
Hinderks_5-7-340> the act – a highly political throwback to the long-
abandoned sumptuary laws <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sumptuary_law>^[298] <#cite_note-Hinderks_5-7-340>  – banned the wearing
of Highland dress by men and boys in Scotland north of the River Forth
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Forth> (i.e. in the
Highlands),^[aq] <#cite_note-342> except for the landed gentry^[ar]
<#cite_note-343> and the Highland regiments of the British Army.^[300]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_1-344> The law was based on previous English
bans in the 16th century against traditional garb in Ireland.^[301]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_3-345> Sir Walter Scott <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott> wrote of the Dress Act: "There was
knowledge of mankind in the prohibition, since it divested the
Highlanders of a dress which was closely in association with their
habits of Clanship and of war."^[302] <#cite_note-BdLC_84-346>

Tartans recorded shortly after the act (thus probably being patterns in
use in the period before proscription) show that a general pattern was
used in a wide area, with minor changes being made by individual weavers
to taste.^[223] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_12-254> E.g., the tartan today
used as the main (red) Mackintosh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Mackintosh> clan tartan,^[303] <#cite_note-347> recorded by the
Highland Society of London <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Highland_Society_of_London> around 1815, was found in variants from
Perthshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire> and Badenoch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badenoch> along the Great Glen <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Glen> to Loch Moy <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Loch_Moy>.^[223] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_12-254> Other such groups
can be found, e.g. a Huntly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntly>-
centred Murray <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray>/Sutherland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Sutherland>/Gordon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon> cluster analysed as clearly related
by Innes of Learney (1938)^[153] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_10-173>  –
distinguished from a different Huntly/MacRae <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Clan_Macrae>/Ross <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Ross>/Grant
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant> group identified by Scottish
Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> and tartan researcher Peter Eslea
MacDonald of Scottish Tartans Authority <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Authority>.^[304] <#cite_note-SRT_Huntly-348> ^[305]
<#cite_note-349> But Scarlett (1990) says that "the old patterns
available are too few in number to permit a detailed study of such
pattern distributions" throughout the Highlands.^[223] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_12-254> Portraits of the era also show that tartan was
increasingly made with identical or near-identical warp and weft
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft> patterns, which had not
always been the case earlier, and that the tartan cloth used was of the
fine twill, with even-warp-and-weft thickness, still used today for
kilts.^[243] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_13-276> ^[261] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_22-297>

Although the Dress Act, contrary to popular later belief, did not ban
all tartan^[306] <#cite_note-Tuckett_6-350> (or bagpipes, or Gaelic),
and women, noblemen, and soldiers continued to wear tartan,^[307]
<#cite_note-BdLC_84-85-351> it nevertheless effectively severed the
everyday tradition of Highland Scots wearing primarily tartan, as it
imposed the wearing of Lowland, English-like clothing for two
generations.^[300] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_1-344> ^[308] <#cite_note-
NatGeo-352> (While some Scotsmen defied the act,^[309] <#cite_note-353>
^[310] <#cite_note-354> there were stiff criminal penalties.)^[311]
<#cite_note-355> It had a demoralising effect,^[as] <#cite_note-357> and
the goal of this and related suppressive measures to integrate the Scots
into Lowland and broader British society^[301] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_3-345> was largely successful.^[298] <#cite_note-
Hinderks_5-7-340> ^[313] <#cite_note-358> By the 1770s, Highland dress
seemed all but extinct.^[314] <#cite_note-359> However, the act may also
ironically have helped to "galvanize clan consciousness" under that
suppression;^[315] <#cite_note-360> Scottish clans, in romanticised
form, were to come roaring back in the "clan tartans" run of the Regency
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_era> (late Georgian <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_era>) to Victorian <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era> period.

women continued wearing tartan during the proscription (1749 portrait of
Flora MacDonald <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_MacDonald> by Allan
Ramsay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Ramsay_(artist)> and Joseph

pattern, later the Murray <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray> of
Tullibardine clan tartan).^[316] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361>

In the interim, Jacobite women continued using tartan profusely, for
clothing (from dresses to shoes), curtains, and everyday items.^[317]
<#cite_note-362> ^[307] <#cite_note-BdLC_84-85-351> While Classicism
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism>-infused portraiture of 18th-
century clan nobles (often painted outside Scotland) typically showed
them in tartan and "Highland" dress, much of it was loyalist regimental
military stylings, the antithesis of Jacobite messaging;^[318]
<#cite_note-363> it foreshadowed a major shift in the politics of tartan
(see § Late Georgian <#Late_Georgian>, below). Nevertheless, this
profuse application of tartan could be seen as rebellious to some
extent, with the reified <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reification>
Highlander becoming "a heroic and classical figure, the legatee
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/legatee> of primitive virtues."^[319]
<#cite_note-364> And by the 1760s, tartan had become increasingly
associated with Scotland in general, not just the Highlands, especially
in the English mind.^[320] <#cite_note-365>

match exactly, and are not surviving patterns.^[321] <#cite_note-366>

After much outcry (as the ban applied to Jacobites and loyalists alike),
the Dress Act was repealed in 1782, primarily through efforts of the
Highland Society of London;^[322] <#cite_note-367> the repeal bill was
introduced by James Graham, Marquis of Graham <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/James_Graham,_3rd_Duke_of_Montrose> (later Duke of Montrose).^[323]
<#cite_note-BdLC_87-368> Some Highlanders resumed their traditional
dress,^[324] <#cite_note-369> but overall it had been abandoned by its
former peasant wearers, taken up instead by the upper and middle
classes, as a fashion.^[325] <#cite_note-370> Tartan had been
"culturally relocated as a picturesque ensemble or as the clothing of a
hardy and effective fighting force" for the crown, not a symbol of
direct rebellion.^[326] <#cite_note-371> R. Martin (1988) calls this
transmutation "the great bifurcation <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
bifurcation> in tartan dress",^[327] <#cite_note-MartinR_53-372> the
cloth being largely (forcibly) abandoned by the original Highland
provincials then taken up by the military and consequently by non-
Highlander civilians. During the prohibition, traditional Highland
techniques of wool spinning and dyeing, and the weaving of tartan, had
sharply declined.^[96] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_222-224-113> ^[299]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_3-341> ^[105] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_colour-122> Commercial production of tartan was to become
re-centred in the Lowlands, in factory villages along the fringe of the
Highlands,^[328] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_14-373> among companies like
Wilsons of Bannockburn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bannockburn> (then
the dominant manufacturer),^[329] <#cite_note-Tuckett_19-374> with the
rise of demand for tartan for military regimental dress <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regimental_tartan>.^[330] <#cite_note-375> Some
tartan weaving continued in the Highlands,^[331] <#cite_note-
Hinderks_Dziennik_127-129-376> ^[332] <#cite_note-377> and would even
see a boost in the late Georgian period.^[331] <#cite_note-
Hinderks_Dziennik_127-129-376> Tartan by this era had also become
popular in Lowland areas including Fife <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Fife> and Lothian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian> and the urban
centres of Edinburgh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh> and
Stirling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling>.^[306] <#cite_note-
Tuckett_6-350> From 1797 to 1830,^[264] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_144-300> Wilsons were exporting large quantities of
tartan (for both men's and women's clothing), first to the British
colonies in Grenada <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada> and Jamaica
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica> (where the affordable, durable,
and bright material was popular for clothing enslaved people <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Slavery_in_the_British_and_French_Caribbean>),^[328] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_14-373> and had clients in England, Northern and Central
Europe, and a bit later in North and South America and the
Mediterranean.^[333] <#cite_note-378> ^[334] <#cite_note-379> However,
by the end of the 18th century, Wilsons had "stiff competition" (in
civilian tartan) from English weavers in Norwich <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich>.^[335] <#cite_note-380>

Because the Dress Act had not applied to the military or gentry, tartan
gradually had become associated with the affluent, rather than "noble
savage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage>" Highlanders,^[336]
<#cite_note-381> ^[337] <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_25-382> ^[338]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_35-383> from the late 18th century and into the
19th,^[339] <#cite_note-384> along with patriotic military-influenced
clothing styles in general;^[340] <#cite_note-Tuckett_10-11-385> tartan
and militarised Highland dress were being revived among the fashion-
conscious across Britain, even among women with military
relatives.^[341] <#cite_note-386> The clans, Jacobitism, and anti-
unionism (none of them any longer an actual threat of civil unrest) were
increasingly viewed with a sense of nostalgia,^[173] <#cite_note-

Charles Edward Stuart in 1788,^[344] <#cite_note-

loyalty and worth.^[338] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_35-383> Adopting the

Even the future George IV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV>
donned Highland regalia for a masquerade ball <https://en.wikipedia.org/

of the gentry were helping design tartans for their own personal use,
according to surviving records from Wilsons.^[173] <#cite_note-
Spinning-197> Jane (Maxwell) Gordon, Duchess of Gordon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Gordon,_Duchess_of_Gordon>, was said to have
"introduced tartan to [royal] court <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Royal_court> ... wearing a plaid of the Black Watch, to which her son
had just been appointed", in 1792; she triggered a fashion of wearing
tartan in London and Paris, though was not immune to caricature by the
disapproving.^[348] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_102-393>

R. Martin (1988) wrote, from a historiographical <https://

Act:^[327] <#cite_note-MartinR_53-372>

    the idea of Highland dress was stored in the collective historical
    attic; when it was revived in the years leading up to 1822, it had
    been forgotten by some two or three generations in civilian dress
    and could be remembered, however deceptively, however naively, to
    have been the ancient dress of the Highlands, not that so recently
    worn as the standard peasant dress before 1746. The ban on tartan
    was hugely successful, but so inimical to a natural historical
    process, that it promoted the violent re-assertion of the tartan,
    sanctioned by a spurious sense of history, in the next century.

The tumultuous events of 18th-century Scotland led to not just broader
public use of tartan cloth, but two particular enduring tartan
categories: regimental tartans and eventually clan tartans.


    Regimental tartans[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

After the period of the early clan militias and the Independent Highland
Companies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Highland_Companies>
(IHCs), over 100 battalions of line, fencible, militia, and volunteer
regiments were raised, between c. 1739 and the end of the Napoleonic
Wars in 1815, in or predominantly in the Highlands,^[349]
<#cite_note-394> a substantial proportion of them in Highland dress. Of
these units, only some had distinct uniform tartans, and of those, only
a small number were recorded to the present day.

Cunliffe, 1853, depicting men of the 42nd and 93rd. The dancer in the

The IHCs were amalgamated in 1739 to become the 43rd (later 42nd)
Regiment of Foot <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
42nd_Regiment_of_Foot>,^[350] <#cite_note-395> called the Black
Watch.^[351] <#cite_note-396> It was the first proper governmental
Highland regiment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_regiment>,
part of the British Army <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army>,
and they wore the belted plaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Belted_plaid> ("great kilt") for dress, and the tailored small kilt
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_kilt> for undress uniform.^[352]
<#cite_note-397> ^[293] <#cite_note-Groves_2-335> ^[353]
<#cite_note-398> For the former garment,^[354] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_178-399> they used a distinctive tartan, which was
designed for the unit.^[355] <#cite_note-Groves_3-400> It was originally
called the "42nd tartan",^[355] <#cite_note-Groves_3-400> so it probably
was not adopted until after the unit was renumbered the 42nd in
1749.^[214] <#cite_note-Newsome_Black_Watch-243> It seems likely that
the tartan was based on those used by the IHCs earlier, but with double
black "tram line" over-checks added.^[214] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Black_Watch-243> ^[356] <#cite_note-401> The Black Watch pattern
was used by various other regiments, and it has been estimated that to
clothe them all, some 30–40 miles (48–64 km) of the tartan had to be
woven before 1750 alone.^[60] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2020-04-72> It
became the basis of various later regimental (and eventually clan)
tartans.^[214] <#cite_note-Newsome_Black_Watch-243> It remains popular
in general-public use under the names "Black Watch", "Government", and
any of "old Campbell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell>",
"hunting Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant>", or "hunting
Munro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Munro>",^[214] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Black_Watch-243> but today officially called "Government No. 1"
by the military. (See illustration in § Popular designs
<#Popular_designs>, below.) The 42nd had separate tratans for its small
kilt until c. 1814^[354] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_178-399> ^[357]
<#cite_note-402> (also used for grenadiers <https://en.wikipedia.org/

After the Jacobite uprisings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jacobite_uprisings>, raising a regiment in service to the king was, for
many Scottish lairds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird>, a way of
rehabilitating the family name, assuring new-found loyalty to the
British (now Hanoverian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
House_of_Hanover>) crown, and currying royal favour (even regaining
forfeited estates).^[361] <#cite_note-406> Exempt from the Dress Act
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_Act>, men in these Highland
regiments of the empire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire>
were given Highland dress as a sort of safe, subsumed Scottish
nationalism.^[362] <#cite_note-407> From c. 1770 onward into the 19th
century, virtually all the regimental tartan was produced by the company
William Wilson & Son of Bannockburn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bannockburn>, the dominant tartan weaver.^[329] <#cite_note-
Tuckett_19-374> Regimental uniforms, including tartans, were left –

blue, and green – to their commanders.^[363] <#cite_note-408> ^[364]

Stuart

Some surviving early regimental tartans include:

  * Loudoun's Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Loudoun%27s_Highlanders> (64th, raised in 1745), used a tartan
    similar to Black Watch, but with over-checks of red and yellow, and
    lacking the two black "tram lines" of Black Watch.^[365]
    <#cite_note-410> ^[366] <#cite_note-411>
  * The 78th (Highlanders) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    78th_(Highlanders)_Regiment_of_Foot> or Ross-shire Buffs (raised
    1793), MacLeod's Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    71st_(Highland)_Regiment_of_Foot> (73rd, later 71st, raised 1777–
    78), and the original Seaforth Highland Regiment <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    72nd_Regiment,_Duke_of_Albany%27s_Own_Highlanders> (78th, later
    72nd, raised 1778)^[at] <#cite_note-412> first used Black Watch,
    then in 1787 adopted a variant of it with thin over-checks of red
    and white.^[367] <#cite_note-413> ^[368] <#cite_note-
    Barnes_&_Allen_84-86-414> ^[369] <#cite_note-415> It eventually
    became the Clan Mackenzie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_Mackenzie> tartan,^[368] <#cite_note-Barnes_&_Allen_84-86-414>
    and it remains used as an official British military tartan,
    designated "Government No. 5A". A slight variation, with yellow in
    place of white, became one of the Clan MacLeod <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacLeod> tartans.^[370] <#cite_note-416>
  * The 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    74th_(Highland)_Regiment_of_Foot> (raised 1787)^[au]
    <#cite_note-417> used another variant of the Black Watch tartan with
    a black-guarded white over-check.^[371] <#cite_note-418> Also in
    1787, the 75th (Highland) Regiment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    75th_(Stirlingshire)_Regiment_of_Foot>, later 75th (Stirlingshire),
    probably used a more distinct tartan, not based on Black Watch, of
    purple and black on a green ground, with thin white and black over-
    checks; it was later called "No. 64 or Abercromby" by Wilsons, and
    though it did not become adopted as an Abercromby/Abercrombie clan
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Abercromby> tartan, variants of
    it became two unrelated clan patterns.^[372] <#cite_note-419>
  * The Gordon Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    92nd_(Gordon_Highlanders)_Regiment_of_Foot> (100th, later 92nd,
    raised 1794) also wore an altered Black Watch <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:
    92nd_(Gordon_Highlanders)_Regiment,_tileable.png>, this time with a
    thin yellow over-check.^[373] <#cite_note-420> ^[374]
    <#cite_note-421> In a rare show of competition to Wilsons, the
    pattern was designed in 1793 and supplied by weaver William Forsyth
    of Huntly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntly>, Aberdeen.^[375]
    <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_159-160-422> This pattern became the
    main tartan of Clan Gordon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_Gordon>.^[376] <#cite_note-423> ^[377] <#cite_note-424>
    Something nearly identical (perhaps with the yellow over-check in a
    different width) was also used by the 8th (Rothesay and Caithness)
    Fencibles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    8th_(Rothesay_and_Caithness)_Fencibles>.^[378] <#cite_note-425>
  * The Cameronian Volunteers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Queen%27s_Own_Cameron_Highlanders> (79th, later Queen's Own Cameron
    Highlanders, raised 1793) used a comparatively distinct tartan
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:
    79th_Regiment_(Cameronian_Volunteers,_Queen%27s_Own_Cameron_Highlanders)_and_Cameron_of_Erracht_tartan,_tileable.png>, later the family tartan of the Cameron of Erracht <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_of_Erracht> branch of Clan Cameron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Cameron>.^[57] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2012-01-68> ^[379] <#cite_note-426> ^[380] <#cite_note-427> It is structurally much like Black Watch, but without black over-checks and with a number of yellow and red over-checks. It has been said to have been designed by the unit leaderor a family member.^[57] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2012-01-68> ^[381] <#cite_note-428>
  * The Fraser Fencibles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Highland_Fencible_Corps#Fraser_Fencibles_(1794)> (raised 1794–95)
    used a tartan with a red ground and green and blue bands, unrelated
    to the Black Watch style.^[382] <#cite_note-429> ^[383]
    <#cite_note-430>
  * The Sutherland Highlanders (93rd) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    93rd_(Sutherland_Highlanders)_Regiment_of_Foot> raised 1799, and
    later the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll_and_Sutherland_Highlanders> (Princess
    Louise's, formed 1881 by amalgamation of the 93rd with the 91st
    Argyllshire Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    91st_(Argyllshire_Highlanders)_Regiment_of_Foot>), may have worn a
    lightened version of Black Watch,^[384] <#cite_note-431> ^[385]
    <#cite_note-432> now sometimes used as one of the Clan Sutherland
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Sutherland> tartans;^[386]
    <#cite_note-433> ^[387] <#cite_note-434> it is also still militarily
    used as sett "Government No. 1A".
  * The Loyal Clan Donnachie Volunteers (raised in 1803) had its own
    uniform tartan, which was later adopted as the hunting Robertson/
    Donnachie/Duncan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Robertson> clan
    tartan.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[389] <#cite_note-436>
  * The Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    72nd_Regiment,_Duke_of_Albany%27s_Own_Highlanders> (formerly
    Seaforth's 72nd), during a trews <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Trews>-wearing period of 1823–1881, wore a tartan called Prince
    Charles Edward Stuart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    File:Prince_Charles_Edward_Stuart_(regimental)_tartan,_tileable.png>, similar to royal Stewart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Stewart_tartan>,^[112] <#cite_note-SRT_PCES-129> as shown in a period painting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:72nd_Highlanders,_uniform,_1844.jpg>. Identified in surviving cloth samples from the mid-18th century^[64] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2016-01-76> (before the regiment) it is one of the oldest setts in continuous production.^[64] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2016-01-76>

By the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, women in Scotland were
especially "desirous to dress in the uniform plaids of their husbands",
in particularly fine-quality cloth, according to records of Wilsons of
Bannockburn.^[348] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_102-393> After the
Highland regiments proved themselves fearless and effective in various
military campaigns, the glory associated with them did much to keep
alive, initially among the gentry and later the general public, an
interest in tartan and kilts, which might have otherwise slipped into
obscurity due to the Dress Act's prohibition.^[390] <#cite_note-437> The
belted plaid was abandoned in favour of the small kilt, around
1814.^[337] <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_25-382> ^[354] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_178-399> After the "clan tartanry" rush of the early to
mid-19th century (see below), various later Highland regiments adopted
some of the recently minted clan tartans for their uniforms (reversing
the original regimental-into-clan-tartan flow). Some of these adoptions
remain in regimental use today.

The Lowland regiments <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowland_regiments>
(dating in some form to 1633 and never before dressed in Highland garb
but in a variant of regular army uniform) were outfitted in tartan trews
in 1881. This both linked them with and distinguished them from the
tartan-kilted Highland regiments.^[391] <#cite_note-438> Typically the
"Government" (Black Watch) tartan was used, though some units later
diversified. Several Highland regiments were again assigned new tartans
that were clan tartans rather than unit-specific ones, into the early
20th century.^[292] <#cite_note-Cowan_2021-333>

Today, about a dozen tartans are officially used (and half a dozen more
unofficially) between all of the surviving historical Scottish regiments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_regiment>, which have largely
been amalgamated since 2006 as battalions into the Royal Regiment of
Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Regiment_of_Scotland>,
part of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish,_Welsh_and_Irish_Division>.^[392]
<#cite_note-439> These tartans are only worn in dress and pipe-band
uniforms, after the practical uniform changes introduced in the early
part of World War II, which did away with tartan kilts and trews in
undress uniforms. (For further information on these tartans and the
modern units using them, see List of tartans § UK military or government
tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_tartans#UK_military_or_government_tartans>.) Some military units
in other countries also have their own tartans. In all, there are at
least 38 documented tartans that have at one time or another been
associated with regiments, though many of them also with clans.^[av]

With an exception dating to 1618^[394] <#cite_note-
Innes_of_Learney_9-10-442> and another to c. 1703–1715^[248]
<#cite_note-Mackay_50-282> (neither of which appear to have survived),
it is generally regarded that tartans associated by name with Scottish
clans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_clan> mostly date to the
early-to-mid 19th century,^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> ^[395]
<#cite_note-PatersonMB_155-443> ^[396] <#cite_note-Ward_Edwards-444>

<#cite_note-HaswellMiller1956-446> ^[399] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_2-447> some few to the late 18th at the
earliest,^[94] <#cite_note-Barnes_&_Allen_266-110> ^[400] <#cite_note-
MackayScobie-448> ^[338] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_35-383> depending on
how one defines "clan tartan". The belief that the clan tartans are an
"ancient" system of symbolic family differentiation is pervasive, even
passionate, but lacks substantive evidence even as it is overwhelmed by
counter-evidence. It is what J. C. Thompson (1992) called "the Great
Tartan Myth",^[132] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150> and James D.
Scarlett (1990) "the Tartan Cult".^[245] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_34-278> Lt.-Col. M. M. Haldane (1931) called it an
assumption, which "has acquired such a formidable weight from mere
reiteration" without "critical examination of evidence".^[401]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_15-16_Haldane-449> Barnes & Allen (1956)
observed:^[94] <#cite_note-Barnes_&_Allen_266-110>

    There is no doubt that many 'setts' had been traditional to certain
    districts for centuries, but the theory that they were a sort of
    Clan uniform seems now to have been quite discredited.

Responding to the claim that clan tartans have "an ancient political
significance", Richard Martin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Richard_Martin_(curator)>, curator of the Fashion Institute of
Technology <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Fashion_Institute_of_Technology> museum and later the Costume Institute
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art>, wrote (1988): "[This] assertion about
history is wrong and can be demonstrated to be perniciously <https://
en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pernicious> wrong".^[402] <#cite_note-450>
According to National Galleries of Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/National_Galleries_of_Scotland> curator A. E. Haswell Miller
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Eliot_Haswell_Miller>
(1956):^[398] <#cite_note-HaswellMiller1956-446>

    To sum up, the presumed heraldic or "family badge" significance of
    the tartan has no documentary support, and the establishment of the
    myth can be accounted for by a happy coincidence of the desire of
    the potential customers, the manufacturer and the salesman. Although
    the antiquity of the "clan tartans" is exaggerated, what might be
    termed their unofficial registration took place during the
    nineteenth century, and if we are prepared to accept some hundred
    and fifty years as sufficient to create "tradition", it may be
    excusable to accept the /fait accompli/ as a pleasant – and perhaps
    not entirely useless – national vanity.

Highland-dress <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_dress> researcher
and curator John Telfer Dunbar added:^[403] <#cite_note-451>

    The desire to give to relics of all kinds greater antiquity than
    they truly possess is manifold. It is a pity that tradition should
    be degraded in this way and the acceptance of such claims by later
    students has been a constant obstacle to research. The more
    difficult task of searching back to original sources has often been
    avoided in favour of easy acceptance.

Just that sort of research was performed by Peter Eslea MacDonald of the
Scottish Tartans Authority <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Authority>, who – using every available surviving
company record and sample – reconstructed and traced the history of
tartan patterns from the leading weaver of the late Georgian through
Edwardian eras, a company instrumental in the actual design, spread, and
acceptance of clan tartans. His conclusion:^[399] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_2-447>

    Today, books and shops dealing with Highland dress <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_dress> will be mainly, if not
    exclusively, concerned with clan tartans. They may seek to suggest
    that these are the actual patterns worn by the Scottish clans
    throughout history, up to and including the Battle of Culloden
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden> in 1746. This is
    not the case. The majority of the pre-1850 patterns bearing clan
    names can only be traced back to the early 19th century and to the
    famous weaving firm of William Wilson & Son of Bannockburn, near
    Stirling.

The notion of clan tartans has been called "an astonishingly successful
marketing story"^[395] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_155-443> and an example of
an invented tradition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Invented_tradition>,^[404] <#cite_note-452> though one that became very
well-accepted by the clans to whom it pertained and by the weaving
industry starting in 1815, as well as by the general public from around
1822 – "adopted enthusiastically by both wearer and seller alike".^[405]
<#cite_note-PatersonMB_Airds-453>

Precursors of clan tartans were regionally distinctive tartans (since at
least the early 18th century, perhaps even the 16th), regimental uniform
tartans (from 1725 onward), and personal tartans of nobles (dating to
perhaps the mid-18th century if not earlier).

Today, clan tartans are an important aspect of Scottish clans, and every
clan has at least one tartan attributed to its name (some officially,
some not, and in a few cases one tartan is shared between multiple
clans). Clan tartans may not have actually been traditional, but they
became conventional.


      Long-running debate[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

tartans are predominantly blue, green and black.^[406] <#cite_note-

Various writers on tartans have supported or opposed the idea of clans
long using distinctive tartans as an identifying badge, interpreting the
scarce evidence as suited their viewpoint.^[aw] <#cite_note-456> Where
one saw a militia uniform, or an individual noble's plaid, another saw a
clan identifier. The 19th-century Celtic scholar John Francis Campbell
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Francis_Campbell> of Islay was
certain that while tartans in general were quite old, "uniform clan
tartans are no older than clan regiments", a view backed by Haldane
(1931) in a series of articles in /The Scots Magazine <https://

followed by many tartan writers later.

The earliest evidence summarised below could have been more a matter of
militia uniform than clan-wide dress; a distinction in that era is
difficult to be certain of today, because troops then were led by landed
gentry and a unit was raised largely on its commander's land from his
clansmen.^[ax] <#cite_note-458> Such definitional uncertainty could also
apply to the 1691 /Grameid/ poem;^[241] <#cite_note-Grameid-274>
describing what appear to be some soldierly uniform tartans,^[ay]
<#cite_note-459> it could be reinterpreted as supporting an early notion
of clan tartans, if one wanted to define that as 'what most of the men
of a clan were wearing into battle'; Scarlett (1990) confirms that there
has been "fiery argument" in favour of a clan tartans
interpretation.^[243] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_13-276> However, Robert
Jamieson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jamieson_(antiquary)>
(1818) reported that the "field dress" plaids of Highland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands> men, for war and hunting, were
different from their everyday dress – made of coarser material and using
patterns intended to blend into natural surroundings, the /cath dath/
or /cath da'/ ('war colour').^[95] <#cite_note-StewartDW_33-111> ^[az]
<#cite_note-461> This casts some doubt on interpretation of militia
tartans as general clan tartans. Most of the later regimental uniform
tartans (which did not become adopted as clan tartans until around the
early 19th century or the late 18th in a few cases, when they did at
all) were variations on the dark, green-based Black Watch tartan, as
detailed above.

J. C. Thompson (1992) noted "a typical Victorian inclination to cite
previous authors with little or no attempt to evaluate their
statements .... Modern analysis cannot afford to be so
uncritical."^[410] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iii-462> Scarlett (1990)
relatedly observed:^[411] <#cite_note-463>

    Wishful proofs are found in profusion in the literature of tartan,
    early and late, and consist of stating an opinion as a fact and
    adding some more or less relevant historical reference in support,
    either implying or stating that this proves the point. That it
    proves nothing at all is neither here nor there, so long as the
    manner of the presentation is sufficiently authoritative; given this
    treatment the wildest theory will be accepted, copied from one book
    to the next and so enter tartan lore. It is almost axiomatic that
    the wilder the theory the more acceptable it will be ....

Even D. W. Stewart (1893), who had sometimes been sympathetic toward the
idea of clan tartans existing before the 19th century, wrote:^[412]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979-StewartDW-Scott-464>

    Some ... assure us that the antiquity of the so-called clan patterns
    is very great, and many writers allege in general terms that these
    designs were used as a clan distinction from the earliest
    period. ... The halo of romance surrounding the Jacobite <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobitism> struggle inclined many, and still
    induces others, to accept as authentic and reliable, statements
    which in different circumstances would be more closely sifted. Thus
    it is that the tartans ... have won much favour, and those who find
    one represented as bearing their name accept it as their ancient
    clan pattern without the inconvenience of investigation, or of
    posing any awkward questions.

The Victorians also engaged in some imaginative invention. Aside from
the outright forgery of the "Sobieski Stewarts <https://
en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Sobieski_Stewarts&action=edit&redlink=1>" (see § 19th century
broad adoption <#19th_century_broad_adoption>, below), another extreme
case is Charles Rogers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Charles_Rogers_(author)>, who in his /Social Life in Scotland/ (1884–86)
fantastically claimed that the ancient Picts <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Picts>' figural designs – which were painted or tattooed on their
bodies, and they went into battle nude ^[413] <#cite_note-465> – must
have been "denoting the families or septs <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Sept#Scotland> to which they belonged" and thus "This practice
originated the tartan of Celtic clans."^[414] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_23-466> Another asserted that tartan was invented
around a thousand years ago by Saint Margaret of Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Margaret_of_Scotland>.^[414] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_23-466>

Aside from the unreliability of early writers (and later copiers of
them), part of the confusion and debate about clan tartans comes down to
definitions. Sir Thomas Innes of Learney <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Thomas_Innes_of_Learney>, writing in 1938 and described as "immensely
keen on [tartan] codification and the importance of it",^[415]
<#cite_note-PatersonMB_162-467> was one of the firmest proponents of the
idea of very old clan tartans (in the particular sense of 'patterns
consistently used for a period by certain clans', not 'patterns named
for certain clans and claimed by them to the present').^[ba]
<#cite_note-468> He held that some setts gradually became associated
with particular families (clans and septs thereof) over time;^[416]
<#cite_note-469> clan territories had mostly become stable by the 16th
century.^[417] <#cite_note-470> D. W. Stewart's 1893 reference shows
various cases of old district tartans later sometimes being identified
for a time with specific families before 19th-century adoption of their
own (usually different) clan tartans.^[bb] <#cite_note-473> Innes of
Learney wrote of clan tartans that (notwithstanding the unusual 1618
case covered below) "the tendency was rather to insist upon a similarity
of general hue than on similarity of detail",^[420] <#cite_note-474> a
vague sense that is not what "clan tartan" usually refers to. He also
reasoned that "it was not until about the 18th century that the clan
tartans became /conscious/ and /acknowledged/ badges of
identification".^[421] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_9-475> However, the
surviving period source material lacks this "acknowledgement" and does
not actually suggest broad adoption of formal clan tartans (with clan
names, particularity of detail, and a symbolic, identifying intent)
until the early 19th century.


      Earliest evidence[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=17>]

The "Sobieski Stuarts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sobieski_Stuarts>" (1842) and later D. W. Stewart (1893) made much of
some changes to the feu duty <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feu_duty>
paid in woven cloth by locals of Noraboll on the island of Islay
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay> to their lords. In 1587, under the
Macleans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Maclean>, the cloth was to
be white, black, and green; in 1617, under the Mackenzies <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Mackenzie>, the demanded cloth-rent changed
to white, black, and grey. These writers were sure, without any further
evidence, that this represented a change of clan tartans.^[422]
<#cite_note-476> ^[bc] <#cite_note-479>

The only clear instance of a clan-based and specific livery <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery> tartan to an early date, rather than
simply regional and later regimental uniformity, is found in a 1618
letter from Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Sir_Robert_Gordon,_1st_Baronet> (in the employ of the Earl of
Sutherland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
John_Gordon,_14th_Earl_of_Sutherland>) to Murray of Pulrossie <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_of_Pulrossie>, chieftain of the Murray
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray> branch in Sutherland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland> but subordinate to the Earl
of Sutherland, chief of Clan Sutherland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Sutherland> (in turn recently become subordinate to the Gordon
earls <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon>). The letter
(rediscovered in 1909) requested Pulrossie "to remove the red and white
lines from the plaides of his men so as to bring their dress into
harmony with that of the other septs" of Sutherland.^[394] <#cite_note-
Innes_of_Learney_9-10-442> The letter does not specify the tartan to
which to conform; there have been sharply conflicting interpretations,
and it is not even certain that it was a tartan that survived to the
present.^[bd] <#cite_note-483>

Stylized bagpiper in green-and-red tartan kilt, red-and-white tartan
hose, red embroidered coat, dark bonnet with red cockade, and an
armorial banner blowing behind him <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:GrantPiper.JPG>This 1714 portrait, by Richard Waitt <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Waitt>, of the piper to the chief of Clan
Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant> does show a broad
green-ish and red tartan, but it does not match any modern Grant
pattern.^[428] <#cite_note-484> ^[be] <#cite_note-486>

A case of general colour-matching: In 1703–04, the chief of Clan Grant
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant> ordered that his "fencible
<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fencible>" men obtain clothing in red
and green tartan^[247] <#cite_note-StewartDW_26-28-281> (vaguely
described as "broad springed"^[247] <#cite_note-StewartDW_26-28-281> but
not specified in detail).^[165] <#cite_note-SCSC_history-188> The
material seems not to have been provided by Grant for them in a
centralised way, but left to each man to furnish by his own means (on
penalty of a fine).^[247] <#cite_note-StewartDW_26-28-281> "He did not
order them to wear the 'Clan Grant Tartan', as one would expect if such
a tartan existed at that time."^[430] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_62-487> Some of the modern Grant tartans also use red
and green; one was designed by Wilsons of Bannockburn in 1819 as "New
Bruce" and shortly adopted by both Grant of Redcastle <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcastle>^[431] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_146-488> and Clan Drummond <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Clan_Drummond>;^[432] <#cite_note-489> one was reconstructed from
an 1838 portrait;^[433] <#cite_note-490> another first appeared in the
dubious /Vestiarium Scoticum/ of 1842^[434] <#cite_note-491> ^[435]
<#cite_note-492> (see below); and so on – none with pre-19th-century
history. Nevertheless, D. W. Stewart (1893) proclaimed on this thin
material that here was "a complete chain of evidence ... of the
existence of a uniform clan pattern at the very start of the eighteenth
century" – despite his own observation that portraits of leading members
of the Grant family in this era do not show them wearing consistent
tartans,^[247] <#cite_note-StewartDW_26-28-281> ^[243] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_13-276> much less ones that agree with modern "official"
Grant tartans.^[396] <#cite_note-Ward_Edwards-444> ^[436]
<#cite_note-493> ^[bf] <#cite_note-494> Scarlett (1990), though thinking
this presaged "the Clan Tartan Idea", notes that "had the men of
Strathspey <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strathspey,_Scotland> been
accustomed to wearing uniform tartans it would not have been necessary
to order them to do so"^[243] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_13-276> (twice
over). He also observes that the lairds of Grant in this period were
unusually bent on uniformity, one of them even issuing moustache
regulations for clansmen;^[243] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_13-276> the
Grant red-and-green order cannot be taken as typical of everyday
Highland practice. Telfer Dunbar (1979) notes that Highland military
discipline hardly existed: "To these independent Highland chieftains
restraint of any kind was irksome and unbearable, and to impose any
rigid military discipline on their followers ... [was] found to be
impossible."^[437] <#cite_note-495> Nevertheless, Mackay (1924)
corroborates Grant militia wearing a livery tartan in 1715.^[248]
<#cite_note-Mackay_50-282>

In 1718, Allan Ramsay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Allan_Ramsay_(poet)> (the writer, father of the artist by the same name)
published the poem /Tartana/, which combined colours with Latinised
family names: "... If shining red Campbella <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Clan_Campbell>'s cheeks adorn .... If lin'd with green Stuarta
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Stewart>'s Plaid we view ... Or
thine Ramseia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Ramsay>, edg'd around
with blue ...." This has sometimes been taken as evidence of early clan
tartans, despite possibly just referring to the edging and lining of
garments (coloured facings were common on jackets of the time).^[438]
<#cite_note-496> ^[bg] <#cite_note-498> Worse for this hypothesis, the
Campbell tartans are predominantly green, Stuart/Stewart red, and Ramsay
red and green. The extant red Campbell tartans are all modern
reconstructions of patterns (that are unlike each other) from
portraits;^[440] <#cite_note-499> ^[441] <#cite_note-500> ^[442]
<#cite_note-501> Stewart/Stuart tartans with significant green date to
the early 19th century^[443] <#cite_note-502> ^[444] <#cite_note-503>
^[445] <#cite_note-504> ^[446] <#cite_note-505> ^[447] <#cite_note-506>
or much later;^[448] <#cite_note-507> ^[449] <#cite_note-508> ^[450]
<#cite_note-509> and the Ramsay blue hunting sett dates to 1950.^[451]
<#cite_note-510>

A Victorian volume, /Old and New Edinburgh/ (1884) by James Grant
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Grant_(1822%E2%80%931887)>,^[452]
<#cite_note-511> stated that one Rev. Joseph Robertson MacGregor
"attired himself in a full suit of the MacGregor tartan" in 1782, upon
repeal of the Dress Act. But it misquoted the original source (and
contained other errors). The original, /A Series of Original Portraits
and Caricature Etchings/ (1842) by John Kay <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/John_Kay_(caricaturist)>, read: "dressed himself in the Highland
costume peculiar to his clan", and says nothing of tartan, much less a
suit of clan tartan.^[453] <#cite_note-512> While 1782 is within the
late-18th-century range accepted by some researchers for some informal
early clan tartans, this is not clear evidence of one.


      Lack of further evidence of early adoption[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=18>]

John Lesley <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lesley>, bishop of Ross,
in 1578 wrote a great deal about Highland customs, including dress, but
did not include clan tartans (despite later being claimed to have been
the original keeper of the /Vestiarium Scoticum/ clan-tartans
manuscript, now known to be a 19th-century forgery).^[454]
<#cite_note-513> In 1688, William Sacheverell, a Manx <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man> politician, described Hebrideans of
the Isle of Mull <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Mull> all
wearing plaids, but the women in a different style of colour and
pattern – not a consistent "clan" tartan.^[240] <#cite_note-Stewart/
Dunbar_Sacheverell-273> Rev. Thomas Morer in 1689 described Highland
garb in some detail, including tartan plaids and hose (made from the
same cloth), but mentions no clan patterns.^[455] <#cite_note-514>
Daniel Defoe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Defoe> (c. 1720)
wrote also in considerable detail of Highland warriors of the prior
century, and noted that the men were organised into "companies, all of a
name", each led by "one of their own clan or family", yet he never
mentions any distinction between tartans of these different groups,
instead describing them all as wearing tartan with red and yellow over-
checks,^[227] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_28-29-258> strongly implying
a regional style. This pattern of 17th- through 18th-century writings
providing specifics of tartan and Highland dress, but nothing about clan
tartans, is consistent.

Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date,
the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather regional
style and personal taste. They frequently depict subjects wearing
multiple tartans at once.^[421] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_9-475> Nor
do the tartans shown match current clan tartans.^[456] <#cite_note-515>
^[457] <#cite_note-516> For example, the famous painting /The MacDonald
Boys Playing Golf/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Attributed_to_William_Mosman_-_Sir_James_Macdonald_1741_-
_1765_and_Sir_Alexander_Macdonald_1744_-_1810_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg>
(1740s), attributed usually to William Mosman <https://en.wikipedia.org/
w/index.php?title=William_Mosman&action=edit&redlink=1> but sometimes to
Jeremiah Davison <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Davison>, shows
them wearing five different tartans, and they are not surviving patterns
(except as later reconstructions from the painting).^[bh]
<#cite_note-518> Period tartans were also often of differing warp and
weft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft> (giving more of a
striped than checked appearance), unlike modern symmetrical
patterns.^[459] <#cite_note-519> Sometimes the portraits were copied,
but with tartans that do not match, as if the designs were up to
artistic whim.^[460] <#cite_note-520> As Scarlett (1990) put it:^[461]
<#cite_note-521>

    "[T]hese portraits have one thing in common: in no case does the
    tartan shown bear any close resemblance to the modern 'Clan'
    tartan. ... There is a great lack of evidence to show that the
    pattern of a tartan had any important significance in the early
    eighteenth century

D. W. Stewart (1893) had also noted this, about both portrait tartans
and "examples of tartan fabrics which can be proved to date from the
risings of 1715 and 1745".^[412] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979-StewartDW-
Scott-464> Many of the portraits by Allan Ramsay <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Ramsay_(artist)> the younger show the same
shoulder plaid but with colours changed, suggesting it was the artist's
own studio prop and used for modelling purposes by his clients who
apparently did not care about the tartan pattern.^[27] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_23-31> ^[166] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> ^[316]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> According to Scottish National
Portrait Gallery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_National_Portrait_Gallery> keeper A. E. Haswell Miller
(1956):^[398] <#cite_note-HaswellMiller1956-446>

    Authentic documentation of the tartan previous to the 19th century
    is limited to a comparatively small number of contemporary
    portraits, and is negative so far as it provides any suggestion of
    heraldic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry> significance or
    "clan badge" intention.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Battle_of_Culloden.jpg>David
Morier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morier>'s /An Incident in
the Rebellion of 1745 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
An_Incident_in_the_Rebellion_of_1745>/. The tartans shown generally do
not resemble modern ones.

According to Trevor-Roper (1983):^[462] <#cite_note-522>

    contemporary evidence concerning the rebellion of 1745 <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobite_rising_of_1745> – whether pictorial,
    sartorial <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sartorial>, or literary –
    shows no differentiation of clans, no continuity of setts....
    Tartans were a matter of private taste, or necessity, only.

David Morier <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Morier>'s well-known
mid-18th-century painting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
An_Incident_in_the_Rebellion_of_1745> of the Highland charge at the 1745
Battle of Culloden <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden>
shows eight Highlanders wearing over twenty different tartans which have
been analysed in detail;^[463] <#cite_note-523> very few of the setts
painted resemble today's clan tartans,^[294] <#cite_note-
Campbell_of_Airds-336> ^[302] <#cite_note-BdLC_84-346> though they are
similar to existing samples of tartan cloth from the era.^[464]
<#cite_note-524> ^[bi] <#cite_note-528> The method of identifying
Highlander friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of
the bonnet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnet_(headgear)#Men>'s
cockade <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockade> or ribbon, or perhaps by
the different plant sprigs worn in the cockade of the bonnet.^[175]
<#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_23-199> ^[132] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150>
^[bj] <#cite_note-531> ^[bk] <#cite_note-533> In particular, the
government Highland militia forces wore a badge in the form of a black
cockade with red saltire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltire>;
according to Mackay Scobie (1946), "each individual wore his own
Highland dress with varied tartans, with the only uniform part being the
'Hanoverian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hanover>' cockade
and large coloured cross on the bonnet."^[471] <#cite_note-534> A 1745
letter on the Scottish troops at Culloden describes "all ye Forces as
well Horse as foot were in Highland Dress except ye body Guards wh. wore
Blue bound wth Red"; i.e., only the bodyguards were wearing a uniform,
and it was not of Highland dress.^[472] <#cite_note-535>

One of many tartan legends has it that the Highland-dress ban of the
Dress Act <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_Act_1746> was enacted
because tartans were used as clan-identifying symbols or uniforms, but
not a trace of this idea can be found in period sources. To the
contrary, Burt (1727–37) was explicit that English objection to Highland
dress (since perhaps 1703–04)^[328] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_14-373>
was /general/, because the garb served to distinguish the Highlanders as
a people apart from the Lowlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Lowlands> and other British (not distinguish Highlander from
Highlander).^[473] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_4-536> ^[bl]
<#cite_note-537> Defoe (c. 1720) likewise mocked Highland dress as what
he saw as a clownish costume that set Highlanders apart from everyone
else, not each other.^[227] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_28-29-258>
Similarly, in an account of Jacobite trials, it was asked whether
defendants had worn "Highland cloaths" in general, with no mention of
clan-identifying patterns.^[474] <#cite_note-538> Extant MacDonald
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Donald> tartan fragments from the
Battle of Culloden do not match each other or any current clan tartan
named MacDonald.^[470] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_20-532> Lord
President <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Lord_President_of_the_Court_of_Session> Duncan Forbes of Culloden
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Duncan_Forbes_of_Culloden_(judge,_born_1685)>, keen on punishing the
Jacobites with disarmament and other penalties, wrote a detailed letter
laying out /pro/ and /con/ points (mostly /con/) regarding the proposed
Highland-dress ban before Parliament passed it, yet never indicated
anything like clan tartans, something that would have been a key
argument to address.^[475] <#cite_note-539>

C. C. P. Lawson (1967) raised a point of logic: "Remembering the
continuous clan feuds and the consequent state of more or less perpetual
hostilities, a recognisable clan plaid would have been a positive danger
to the wearer outside his own territory."^[476] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_15_Lawson-540> This may explain why the handful of
early apparent examples of groups of men in similar tartan seem to have
the nature of militia uniforms and are mentioned in the context of
"fencible <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fencible>" bodies or outright
battle (possibly aside from the 1618 case).^[bm] <#cite_note-541> Lawson
also states: "The '45 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Jacobite_rising_of_1745> supplies no evidence that tartans were used as
clan insignia .... Relics of those tartans which were worn at Culloden
or of the pre-1745 period bear no resemblance to any known modern
tartan."^[476] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_15_Lawson-540> The Lord Lyon
King of Arms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms> in
1948, Sir Francis James Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Francis_James_Grant>, wrote that pre-1745 tartans were qualitatively
different from those of the 19th century and later.^[477]
<#cite_note-542> Scottish United Services Museum <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_War_Museum> curator Dunbar (1979) notes
this as well.^[478] <#cite_note-543>

The Jacobite poets wrote much about the rousing appeal of Highland clans
and Highland dress, even tartan specifically, but never mentioned clan
tartans.^[479] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_16-17-544> Similarly, multiple
large volumes of traditional Highland folklore were collected and
published by John Francis Campbell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
John_Francis_Campbell> in 1860–1862 and Alexander Carmichael <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Carmichael> (who also collected tartan
samples) in 1900, but they are devoid of any recorded references to clan
tartans^[479] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_16-17-544> (despite post-dating
the popularisation of the notion among city-dwellers and the upper class).

The idea of groups of men wearing the exact same tartan as an identifier
is thought to originate (aside, again, from the odd 1618 case) from
Highland regiment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_regiment>
units in the 18th century, starting with the Black Watch in
1739/1749.^[294] <#cite_note-Campbell_of_Airds-336> ^[214] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Black_Watch-243> According to Trevor-Roper (1983):^[480]
<#cite_note-545>

    [I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of
    differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were
    multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated; and
    when the wearing of tartan by civilians was resumed, and the
    romantic movement encouraged the cult of the clan, the same
    principle of differentiation was easily transferred from regiment to
    clan.

Particular regiments were often dominated by men raised from the same
clan lands, and this may have blurred the line between regimental
uniform and clan-identifying tartan. (And several tartans of extinct
regiments survive today as clan tartans.) Newsome (2006) writes: "the
practice of clans wearing these regimental tartans may have in fact been
the inspiration for the 'clan tartan' system as we now know it."^[214]
<#cite_note-Newsome_Black_Watch-243> Telfer Dunbar (1979), on the idea
of the early Independent Highland Companies <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Independent_Highland_Companies> using distinct uniform tartans: "I
feel sure that here we have much of the 'clan tartan' origin."^[481]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_159-546> The end of the 18th and beginning
of the 19th centuries brought an unprecedented level of influence of
military clothing styles, including Highland regimental, on civilian
attire (even for women), especially among the social elite connected to
regiments.^[340] <#cite_note-Tuckett_10-11-385> Some regimental tartans
appear to have been named after their commanding officers, and this may
be how they came to be associated with family/clan names over
time.^[482] <#cite_note-547> ^[368] <#cite_note-
Barnes_&_Allen_84-86-414> Banks & de La Chapelle (2007):^[323]
<#cite_note-BdLC_87-368>

    the notion of differentiation of tartan by clans might have evolved
    from this desire to distinguish on Highland regiment uniform from
    another. Certainly, its classification for military use laid the
    groundwork for many subsequent designs and the movement toward
    uniformity.

Scarlett (1990) also observed the connection to regional or "district"
tartans:^[245] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_34-278>

    [B]asic patterns prevailed over wide areas and were modified by
    local weavers for their own ends. It can easily be seen that a local
    pattern of this kind, made for a captive clientele, might have
    become identified with the people of that locality who were
    themselves predominantly of one Clan or family group and its
    adherents and, when the belief grew up that Clan tartans had been
    worn since the beginning of time, have become, by retrospection, the
    Clan tartan of that group. There is no evidence that the Highlanders
    themselves looked on tartan in that light, however ....

Haswell Miller (1956) similarly noted: "We can ... readily accept that
certain dyes would prevail in different regions and that traditional
types of pattern might be followed in various parts."^[398] <#cite_note-
HaswellMiller1956-446> Martin Martin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Martin_Martin> in 1703 had described tartans as being identifiably
specific to particular regions, but not clans.^[244] <#cite_note-
Scarlett/Stewart/Dunbar_Martin-277> There are numerous cases of tartans
loosely associated with districts later becoming clan tartans. The best-
documented case^[8] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> is the
Tullibardine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullibardine> pattern, one
of the few modern clan tartans that can be traced (at all, not as a clan
tartan) to the pre-proscription period.^[316] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> ^[8] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-
b-8> It was long associated with Perthshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Perthshire>, and later adopted as the Murray <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray> of Tullibardine clan tartan, but sold
by Wilsons as simply "Tullibardine" as late as c. 1830–40, and it was
found for sale in a market by W. & A. Smith around 1850, who also said
it was worn then by Charles Murray, Earl of Dunmore <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Murray,_7th_Earl_of_Dunmore>;^[316]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> the first record of the
pattern as "Murray of Tullibardine" is in their 1850 book.^[8]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> It appears in at least five
early portraits; four date to c. 1740–1750, the first of an unknown
female sitter attributed to Cosmo Alexander <https://en.wikipedia.org/

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Ramsay_(artist)> (with the cloth
painting completed by Joseph van Aken <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Joseph_van_Aken>) which are not of any known Murrays (but of a Campbell
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Campbell,_4th_Earl_of_Loudoun>, a
MacLeod <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_MacLeod_(The_Wicked_Man)>,
and a MacDonald <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_MacDonald>).^[316]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> It is not until 1770 that a
known Murray is painted wearing it (John Murray, Earl of Dunmore
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray,_4th_Earl_of_Dunmore>, by
Joshua Reynolds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds>),^[316]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> which still does not
necessarily make it a "clan tartan" at that early a date ("evidence for
its historic use by that branch [of Clan Murray] is circumstantial at
best").^[8] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> The oldest version
of it differs slightly as to colours and sett from the modern clan
version.^[8] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8> ^[bo] <#cite_note-550>

Similarly, according to the Scottish Register of Tartans <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Register_of_Tartans>, the district tartan
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Huntly_district_tartan,_tileable.png> for Huntly <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntly>,^[304] <#cite_note-SRT_Huntly-348>
originating in more complex form as the personal tartan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Marchioness_of_Huntly%27s_tartan,_tileable.png> of a Marchioness of
Huntly^[484] <#cite_note-SRT_Marchioness-551> (probably Henrietta
Mordaunt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Alexander_Gordon,_2nd_Duke_of_Gordon>), was in use as a regional tartan
since at least "the '45", and worn at Culloden by clansmen of Brodie
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Brodie>, Forbes <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Forbes>, Gordon <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Clan_Gordon>, MacRae <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Macrae>,
Munro <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Munro>, and Ross <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Ross>, "which gives a strong indication of
the greater antiquity of the 'District' setts compared to the Clan
tartans."^[484] <#cite_note-SRT_Marchioness-551>

Some surviving early records of tartan manufacture are those of the
Orphan Hospital Manufactory and Paul's Work, in Edinburgh, for the
period 1734–37 and 1751–52; tartans were not named but given numeric
designations such as "No. 2nd".^[159] <#cite_note-SRT_NRS-181> In 1745,
the /Caledonian Mercury <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Caledonian_Mercury>/ of Edinburgh carried an advertisement for a "Great
Choice of Tartans, the newest Patterns" – not clan or even district
tartans, but newly devised ones, suggesting a fashion market driven by
novelty not supposed "heraldic" traditions. Even clan-tartans booster D.
W. Stewart (1893) conceded: "This advertisement, it may be urged, is a
stumbling-block in the way of those who argue for the antiquity of clan
patterns; for it seems peculiar that, when the city was filled with
Highlanders of all ranks and many clans, they should be offered not
their ancient setts ...."^[485] <#cite_note-StewartDW+Trevor-
Roper_on_1745_ad-552> Other advertisements for tartan from 1745 to the
early 19th century did not mention clans, or focus on the patterns at
all, but rather on the forms in which the cloth could be ordered.^[486]
<#cite_note-553> Even immediately after the repeal of the Dress Act in
1782, the demand was for "latest patterns and bright colours",^[487]
<#cite_note-554> with no hint of a family heraldry aspect.

William Wilson & Son of Bannockburn, just south of the dividing line
between the Highlands and Lowlands,^[488] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_3-4-555> were the first large-scale commercial tartan
producers;^[106] <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123> founded c. 1765,^[1]
<#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> they had become the foremost supplier of
tartan to the military by around 1770, and the dominant tartan weaver in
general.^[329] <#cite_note-Tuckett_19-374> It was an endeavor that
required the introduction of tartan recording, of standardisation of
setts and dyes, and of consistency and quality control.^[1] <#cite_note-
Newsome_1994-1> ^[489] <#cite_note-556> ^[488] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_3-4-555> Wilsons corresponded with their agents
(especially the son, James Wilson)^[103] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_145-120> in the Highlands to get information and
samples of cloth from the various districts to enable them to reproduce
"perfectly genuine patterns". Wilsons recorded over 200 setts in
addition to ones they designed in-house, collected in their 1819 /Key
Pattern Book/ of around 250 setts^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> (among
earlier in-house volumes to the 1770s). These tartans were numbered,
named after places, or given fanciful names such as "Rob Roy <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Roy_MacGregor>", later sometimes family names
(after prominent members), sometimes foreign names like "Coburg", but
usually not those of clans,^[264] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_144-300>
^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[490] <#cite_note-557> ^[132]
<#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150> nor, when they did, often matching
present clan patterns.^[491] <#cite_note-BdLC_104-558> ^[bp]
<#cite_note-559> A large proportion of the modern clan tartans,
however, /can/ be traced to this work – just often originally with
numbers or unrelated names.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> The
evidence of direct adoption from Wilsons happening frequently completely
overwhelms "ancient clan tartans" sentiment.^[bq] <#cite_note-572>

The /Scottish National Dictionary/, in providing an unusually discursive
definition of /tartan/, includes: "[T]owards the end of the 18th century
and largely through the enterprise of Messrs Wilson, weavers in
Bannockburn, a series of tartans, each ascribed to a certain clan, was
devised and is now accepted as authoritative, though almost entirely
unhistorical."^[504] <#cite_note-573> Analysing the direct and strong
influence of Wilsons' /Key Pattern Book/ (/KPB/) on the later adoption
of clan tartans (see next section), Eslea MacDonald (2012)
concluded:^[505] <#cite_note-574>

    Some of the 1819 /KPB/ setts no longer retain their original names,
    others were altered or were the basis for a number of variations
    which were named or simply numbered .... Whatever their origins,
    these patterns gave rise to the idea of clan tartans as we know them
    today. In a very few cases a pattern's origins may have indeed been
    a lot older than the 1819 /KPB/ but their contemporary names were
    almost always the work of Wilsons or subsequent writers.

The Cockburn Collection of 56 tartan samples (some of them duplicates)
was put together between 1810 and c. 1825 (most likely 1816–25)^[506]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575> ^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>
by Lt.-Gen. Sir William Cockburn, and is now in the Mitchell Library
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Library> in Glasgow <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow>.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>
^[507] <#cite_note-576> This collection does ascribe particular family
names to many of these setts (probably naming them after prominent
individuals),^[506] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575> but only
sometimes corresponding to current clan tartan associations (indeed,
some patterns that are today associated with particular clans were given
multiple different names in the Cockburn Collection).^[br]
<#cite_note-578> There are many conflicts in name-to-pattern
associations between this collection and that of the Highland Society of
London <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Society_of_London> around
the same time.^[506] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575>

Even David Stewart of Garth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
David_Stewart_of_Garth>, who was to become one of the chief proponents
of the idea of clan tartans, observed in 1814 only that various heads of
families seemed to have selected personal tartans and that there were
also district tartans.^[509] <#cite_note-579> When Garth and his
Highland Society of London solicited clan tartans from chiefs in 1815
(see below), Col. Alexander Robertson of Struan, Chief of Clan
Robertson/Donnachaidh/Duncan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Robertson>, wrote back:^[510] <#cite_note-580>

    It does not appear to be appertained, either by tradition or by
    authentick history, that the different Clans in the Highlands of
    Scotland, wore any distinctive pattern or tartan. It is well known
    that they all had particular Colours, or Standards <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_colours,_standards_and_guidons>,
    emblematical of some of their most honourable attachments, but as
    far as I have been able to discover, they wore no uniform Garb.

At the beginning of the 19th century, a letter from an Inverness tailor
to Wilsons of Bannockburn requested fine tartan cloth to be used for
women's clothing, because the fashion was to wear husbands' regimental
tartans (not clan tartans).^[348] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_102-393>
In 1829, responding negatively to the idea of Lowland and Borders
"clans" wearing their own tartans, Sir Walter Scott <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott> – who was instrumental in helping
start the clan-tartans fervour in the first place – wrote "where had
slept this universal custom that nowhere, unless in this MS. [the
draft /Vestiarium Scoticum/, published ultimately in 1842] is it even
heard of? ... I would rather suppose that the author had been some
tartan-weaver zealous for his craft, who wished to extend the use of
tartan over the whole kingdom."^[511] <#cite_note-581> Also in the same
year, he wrote: "The idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans
is but a fashion of modern date in the Highlands themselves".^[512]
<#cite_note-582>

Another of the tartan legends has it that Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of
Gordon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Alexander_Gordon,_4th_Duke_of_Gordon>, commissioned the design of a clan
tartan based on Black Watch in 1793, kept one of three designs, then
passed the other two on to cadet branches <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cadet_branch> of the family.^[513] <#cite_note-583> This tale can
be traced in unembellished form to 1793 records of weaver William
Forsyth of Huntly which do not say this at all, only that Forsyth
provided three potential designs for a /regiment/ tartan, with yellow
over-checks in various configurations, of which the Duke selected no. 2
for the unit, the 92nd Gordon Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/92nd_(Gordon_Highlanders)_Regiment_of_Foot>.^[375] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_159-160-422>

Scarlett (1990) surmises that there must have been /some/ informal clan
tartans – a confluence of district tartans that had become associated
with particular families, and adoptions of regimental uniform tartans by
them – by the late 18th century, otherwise there is no explanation for
where Stewart of Garth got the idea.^[514] <#cite_note-584> Scottish
United Services Museum curator Maj. I. H. Mackay Scobie (1942),^[400]
<#cite_note-MackayScobie-448> Haswell Miller (1947),^[515]
<#cite_note-585> and Barnes & Allen (1956),^[94] <#cite_note-
Barnes_&_Allen_266-110> also zeroed in on this timeframe. Eslea
MacDonald (2010-11) observes, for example, the Murrays using the common
Tullibardine regional pattern in portraits and in bed hangings at their
clan seat, Blair Castle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Castle>,
1770 – c. 1780 and possibly earlier.^[316] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> Telfer Dunbar (1979), considering the
1703–04 Grant proclamation and the early regiments, suggests that "any
uniformity of tartan was only to be found in an organised body of
troops, or the 'tail' or following of a chief."^[430] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_62-487> These possible comparatively early, informal
clan tartans of the late-18th-century simply cannot usually be
identified (when they survived) until the early 19th century.


      19th century broad adoption[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=19>]

It has been suggested by a modern chief of Clan Campbell <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell> and another of the clan executives
that the clan had informally adopted what is now known as old Campbell
or Black Watch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell#Tartans>
tartan by the early 19th century, because so many of their men were
already wearing it as part of regimental uniform^[406] <#cite_note-
Ian_Campbell-454> (three of the Independent Highland Companies that
amalgamated into the Black Watch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
42nd_Regiment_of_Foot> regiment in 1739–1751 were Campbell units).^[481]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_159-546> Some time in or after 1806, when
he became clan chief, the city-dwelling politician George Campbell, 6th
Duke of Argyll <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
George_Campbell,_6th_Duke_of_Argyll>, created his own personal tartan,
of Black Watch with a thin over-check of white and yellow added,^[516]
<#cite_note-586> "to differentiate himself from the rest of the
Campbells", i.e. because they were already so often wearing Black
Watch.^[406] <#cite_note-Ian_Campbell-454> This essentially may have
been one of the earliest attested surviving clan tartans (and the duke's
variant was an early declared personal tartan of a noble).^[bs]

The idea arose among Scottish expatriates (especially in the Celtic
societies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_society>, which
encouraged members to wear "appropriate" tartans),^[517] <#cite_note-
Tuckett_15-588> eager to "preserve" Highland culture,^[1] <#cite_note-
Newsome_1994-1> ^[517] <#cite_note-Tuckett_15-588> ^[518]
<#cite_note-589> that tartans had traditionally been named and that the
names represented clan affiliations.^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1>

to be wearing Black Watch (42nd regiment) tartan, as it lacks the yellow
over-check of 92nd Regiment, which became the Gordon clan tartan. This
was only about a year before the Highland Society solicited clan patterns.

On 8 April 1815, the society resolved that the clan chiefs each "be
respectfully solicited to furnish the Society with as much of the Tartan
of his Lordship's Clan as will serve to Show the Pattern and to
Authenticate the Same by Attaching Thereunto a Card bearing the
Impression of his Lordship's Arms."^[526] <#cite_note-Urquhart_18-598>
Many had no idea of what their tartan might be or whether they had
one,^[527] <#cite_note-599> some provided only a vague description, and
some claimed they had none.^[523] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_158-159-595>

will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a
perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it
with my Arms."^[526] <#cite_note-Urquhart_18-598> Finding no agreement
within his clan on a pattern, Robertson of Struan ended up adopting the
regimental tartan of the Loyal Clan Donnachie (Robertson) Volunteers;
being based on the Black Watch pattern, it could not pre-date the late
18th century.^[531] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_4-605> On the other

engaged in correspondence to "send ... specimens of all coloured Tartans
used by these Clans ...said to exceed thirty in number", to a writer in
Italy preparing a book on clan tartans;^[533] <#cite_note-607> the same
year, they also produced their /Key Pattern Book/ of over 200 tartans
(representing only a fraction of their total tartan output, presumably
the most marketable designs, and not always under the same names as
found in contemporary collections of Wilsons' tartan samples such as the
Cockburn collection and that of the Highland Society).^[534]
<#cite_note-608>

According to Trevor-Roper (1983), Wilsons were in a direct "alliance"
with the Highland Society of London by 1819; the former saw a great
marketing opportunity, and the latter provided a veneer of
respectability as Wilsons helped the society pin tartans to clan
names.^[535] <#cite_note-609> ^[536] <#cite_note-610> Banks & de La
Chapelle (2007) concur: "The Wilson firm worked in tandem with the
Highland Society, preparing tartan samples for the latter to certify as
belonging to one clan or another."^[491] <#cite_note-BdLC_104-558> Clan
nobles (who sometimes contradicted each other, within the same clan, on
what their tartan was or should be)^[537] <#cite_note-611> were
apparently also "ready to adopt changes at the mere dictation of fancy"
to improve designs.^[538] <#cite_note-612> From the "authentications"
they received 1815–26, the society built up a clan-tartan collection
(now in the National Museum of Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
National_Museum_of_Scotland>), with 34 authenticated specimens and about
40 others.^[523] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_158-159-595> ^[539]
<#cite_note-613> ^[bw] <#cite_note-614> Other such societies generated
more interest, belief, and demand.^[540] <#cite_note-615> According to
the analysis by Eslea MacDonald (2012), "Most of the pieces sealed [by
clan chiefs] and deposited with the Society at that time were patterns
woven, and in the majority of cases appear to have been designed, by
Wilsons. This obviously means they could not have existed prior to c1765
when William Wilson started his business."^[531] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald2012_4-605> So many of Wilsons' stock tartans from their /
Key Pattern Book/ of 1819 were being renamed for clans that J. C.
Thompson (1992) wrote: "Clearly the naming of tartans was just getting
started in 1819",^[132] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150> and: "There was
nothing people wanted more than an ancient clan tartan system, and they
were determined to have one."^[541] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_v-616> By
1821, advertisements for tartan cloth had shifted to include language
like "true", "warranted", and "original", and began to stress antiquity
and family connections.^[542] <#cite_note-617>

The 1822 visit of George IV to Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Visit_of_George_IV_to_Scotland>, in Highland garb and with a great deal
of tartan-festooned public ceremony (arranged by Stewart of Garth and
romanticist <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism> writer Sir
Walter Scott <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott> of the Celtic
Society of Edinburgh <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Celtic_Society_of_Edinburgh&action=edit&redlink=1>), had a
profound tartan-boosting effect, including the invention of new clan-
specific tartans to suit^[543] <#cite_note-Moncreiffe_24-618> ^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[544] <#cite_note-619> (or renaming of
old tartans to have clan names),^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> ^[545]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_36-620> as clan chiefs had been asked to attend
in clan tartans.^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> It caused a boom in the
tartan-weaving business,^[492] <#cite_note-Tuckett_17-560> and a broader
public notion that tartans should be named for families.^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> "When
these two [Scott and Stewart of Garth] stage-managed the King's
visit ... they fixed the Clan Tartan idea in the public mind."^[545]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_36-620> Wilsons' pattern book in 1822 had
expanded significantly with tartans named for clans, in addition to all
their numbered setts.^[503] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_149-571> According
to R. Martin (1988), Wilsons and other weavers were made aware of the
king's planned visit three or four years in advance, and had all that
time to pad their catalogues with additional designs and to assign clan
names to patterns often "probably picked entirely out of the air."^[546]
<#cite_note-MartinR_54-621> He added that "anyone looking at the tartan
pattern books of 1819 to 1822 would have realized the cacophony of
different names for the same [pattern], the chaos of clan attributions,
and the complete capriciousness of that association."^[547]
<#cite_note-622> A telling letter from a tailor, archived among the
Wilsons papers, to the company in 1822 asked: "Please send me a piece of
Rose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Rose> tartan, and if there
isn't one, please send me a different pattern and call it Rose."^[494]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_5-562>

By 1824, an invitation to the Atholl Gathering <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atholl_Gathering>, one of the earliest of the
modern Highland games <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games>
festivals, made it clear that participants should arrive "in the plaids
or Tartans of their Clans".^[548] <#cite_note-Armstrong_148-623> In
1829, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Thomas_Dick_Lauder> complained to Walter Scott about all the "uncouth,
spurious, modern [tartans] which are every day manufactured, christened
after particular names, and worn as genuine",^[549] <#cite_note-624> and
also of "clans ... at this moment ignorantly disputing for the right to
the same tartans which in fact belong to none of them but are merely
modern inventions for clothing Regimental Highlanders".^[550]
<#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_116-625> Scott himself was backpedalling
away from what he had helped create, and was suspicious of the recent
claims about "ancient" clan tartans: "it has been the bane of Scottish
literature and disgrace of her antiquities, that we have manifested an
eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors
which we adopt too hastily ourselves."^[551] <#cite_note-626>

A "busy" tartan of broad red bands, medium green ones, and thin white
ones <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Scott_tartan_(Vestiarium_Scoticum).png>The Scott <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Scott> tartan invented by the "Sobieski
Stuarts" around 1829, eventually published in the 1842 /Vestiarium/.
Based on the c. 1819 MacGregor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Gregor>, the tartan was rejected (along with other Lowland family
tartans) by Walter Scott <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott>,
but remains the most popular Scott tartan.^[552] <#cite_note-627>

A wave of highly dubious books were published, all purporting to reveal
true clan histories and tartans; they presented little in the way of
evidence, but they caused enthusiastic adoption of clan tartans. The
first of these, in 1831, was /The Scottish Gaël or Celtic Manners, as
Preserved Among the Highlanders/ by James Logan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Logan_(writer)>, containing 54 tartans
(based on Wilsons' collection, that of the Highland Society of London,
and other sources he alleged but did not name, plus some he collected or
devised himself); the author ignored advice from Wilsons on which were
actually old tartans, and included some erroneous, fictitious, and
incomplete setts.^[553] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_153-628> ^[554]
<#cite_note-629> ^[bx] <#cite_note-630> He also included untenable
assertions about the designs' antiquity; "Logan took the line that
everything Highland was rooted impossibly far in the past", and was
mocked in /The Pall Mall Gazette <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
The_Pall_Mall_Gazette>/ for it.^[545] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_36-620>
Meanwhile, Wilsons and other weavers simply adopted some patterns from
his book due to demand,^[555] <#cite_note-BdLC_106-108-631> ^[492]
<#cite_note-Tuckett_17-560> ^[556] <#cite_note-Armstrong_60-61-632> and
also took to inventing all-new "clan tartans" to keep up with the
growing market for patterns associated with names.^[557]
<#cite_note-633> The archived correspondence of Wilsons in the 1830s
shows that the company was frequently pressured by merchants for the
"truest" and "real" clan patterns.^[558] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_151-634> Logan, despite himself being involved in sham
clan tartanry, observed that "fanciful varieties of tartan ... were
being passed off as genuine" by Wilsons and other weavers.^[494]
<#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_5-562>

Logan was followed in 1842 by /Vestiarium Scoticum <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestiarium_Scoticum>/ by the so-called Sobieski
Stuarts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobieski_Stuarts>, purporting to
contain 75 centuries-old clan tartans, illustrated in great detail but
from vague textual descriptions.^[559] <#cite_note-635> Although it is
now known to have been largely a forgery,^[560] <#cite_note-636> ^[561]
<#cite_note-Armstrong_61-637> ^[by] <#cite_note-641> many of the visual
tartan designs in this "final – and fantastic – codification"^[561]
<#cite_note-Armstrong_61-637> of clan tartans were nevertheless adopted
and still survive as accepted tartans of clans,^[565] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_history-642> ^[566] <#cite_note-BdLC_108-643> especially
for Lowland clan names (which had hitherto never been associated with
tartan or Highland garb at all).^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>
^[173] <#cite_note-Spinning-197> ^[567] <#cite_note-644> ^[568]
<#cite_note-645> Starting in 1822, Borders <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Scottish_Borders> families had been redefining themselves as clans,
and the book encouraged more of them to take on clan tartans and open
clan societies.^[569] <#cite_note-646> Modern critics have even praised
the lasting socio-cultural accomplishement of the Sobieski-Stuarts'
works in helping establish a systemic clan-tartans legend while
recognizing the bogus nature of their material.^[bz] <#cite_note-648>

(The socio-political background of these events and their overall impact
on tartan in general are presented at § Late Georgian <#Late_Georgian>
and § Victorian <#Victorian>, below.)

Trevor-Roper (1983) believed that the Sobieski Stuarts had been in
direct communication with manufacturers like Wilsons, and were advising
clan chiefs on which tartans to choose, from as early as 1819;^[571]
<#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_39-649> J. C. Thompson (1992) agreed.^[541]
<#cite_note-Thompson1992_v-616> Dick Lauder certainly said they were
doing so by 1829, and that Wilsons were already weaving many Sobieski
Stuart samples by that year;^[572] <#cite_note-650> the company's own
records the same year confirm orders for designs from the Sobieski
Stuarts.^[573] <#cite_note-651> /Vestiarium/ was followed soon after
by /The Costume of the Clans/ published by the Sobieski Stuarts in
1845;^[555] <#cite_note-BdLC_106-108-631> the illustrations it provided,
allegedly based on portraits, have proven to be largely a mixture of
error and invention.^[574] <#cite_note-652> By 1849, John Sobieski
Stuart was in discussion with a publisher to produce a new, cheaper
edition of /Vestiarium/, in a series of small volumes "so that it might
be rendered as available as possible to manufacturers and the trades in
general concerned in Tartan ... and it was for the[ir] advantage and
use ... that I consented to the publication." The same letter also
proposed binding the manufacturers by contract to produce tartans that
conformed exactly to the Sobieski Stuarts' specifications.^[575]
<#cite_note-653>

Weavers like Wilsons were complicit, not passive, in the tartan boom.
They had lost much of their military and export markets after major wars
ended and colonies in the Americas and elsewhere had become more self-
sufficient.^[498] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_64-566> "The concept of
differentiated clan tartans, newly popularized, was codified and
developed by canny manufacturers .... Since the repeal of the [Dress
Act], these tartan makers saw the prospect of a vast new market."^[265]
<#cite_note-BanksdeLaChapell_100-301> According to Alastair Campbell of
Airds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Alastair_Lorne_Campbell_of_Airds>:^[405] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_Airds-453>

    One factor which has been decisive throughout the history of the
    development of the modern system [of clan tartans] has been the
    influence of the tartan manufacturers .... As with any marketing
    organisation it was important to maintain a steady flow of "new
    products", and every year new patterns were produced .... The idea
    of individual tartans providing a clan or family identity was a most
    attractive one, which was adopted enthusiastically by both wearer
    and seller alike.

This heavy promotion for decades of the clan-tartans idea has been
described as "inciting a rush to lay claim to the tartan to which one's
family was 'entitled'".^[576] <#cite_note-BdLC_26-654> Other 19th-
century clan-tartan works followed.^[565] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_history-642> Logan (by then president of the Highland
Society of London)^[571] <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_39-649> returned, with
illustrator Robert Ranald McIan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
R._R._McIan>, with /The Clans of the Scottish Highlands/ in several
volumes 1843–1849, which had inconsistently hand-coloured portraits of
chiefs in clan tartans, which he stated were "acknowledged by the
present chiefs and clans".^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> /The
Clans of the Highlands of Scotland/ in 1850 by Thomas Smibert drew
heavily on Wilsons' patterns and on Logan.^[577] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_196-655> In the same year, /Authenticated Tartans of the
Clans and Families of Scotland/ by William & Andrew Smith was based on
trade sources such as Wilsons, competing mill Romanes & Paterson of
Edinburgh, and army clothier George Hunter's pre-1822 collection of
setts (and some consultation with historian W. F. Skene <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Forbes_Skene>).^[577] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_196-655> ^[410] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iii-462> Also in
1850, Gen. James Browne published /History of the Highlands and the
Highland Clans/, another /Vestiarium/ knock-off.^[571] <#cite_note-
Trevor-Roper_39-649>

In 1871, Gaelic folklorist and Highland dress fancier John Francis
Campbell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Francis_Campbell> of Islay
wrote in /Clan Tartans/:^[578] <#cite_note-656>

    I have come to the conclusion that Sir Walter Scott and my friends
    the Editors of the /Vestiarium Scoticum/ and Scotch Manufacturers of
    tartans are together responsible for the present flourishing and
    luxuriant crop of brilliant clan tartans .... I do not believe that
    the distinctions which are now made as to Clan Tartans ever
    prevailed at all, till Tartan became an important manufacture in
    Scotland in the reign of George the 4th

J. Claude produced the tartan pattern sample book /Clans Originaux/ in
Paris c. 1880, and some tartans were adopted from it,^[ca]
<#cite_note-659> though its 185 samples were mostly of already-known
tartans.^[19] <#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> A second edition of /The
Costume of the Clans/ was published in 1892.^[581] <#cite_note-660>
Another influential book was Donald W. Stewart's /Old & Rare Scottish
Tartans/ (1893), which included swatches of fabric; several accepted
clan tartans date to this work.^[582] <#cite_note-661>

Books of this era also introduced lists of alleged clan septs <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sept#Scotland>, families of different surnames
(often of English, Norman <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Normans>,
or other non-Gaelic derivation) supposedly linked to particular clans as
"extended family". It was a means of greatly increasing tartan sales by
attaching many more names to extant tartan designs, but not well-
grounded in any historical reality.^[583] <#cite_note-
Duncan_of_Sketraw-662> ^[584] <#cite_note-663> ^[401] <#cite_note-
TelferDunbar1979_15-16_Haldane-449> Two such works, both published by
W. & A. K. Johnston were: /Tartans of the Clans and Septs of Scotland/
by James Grant in 1886, revised by Henry Whyte in 1906 in more of a
picture-book format (three tartans make their first appearance in the
1886 edition,^[585] <#cite_note-664> and various more in the 1906
version, with no provenance);^[586] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_20,_197-198-665> and /What Is My Tartan? or, The Clans of
Scotland, with Their Septs and Dependents/ by Adam Frank in 1896.^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>

The romanticised notion of clan tartans had become deeply embedded in
the Scottish imagination and further afield.^[173] <#cite_note-
Spinning-197> ^[587] <#cite_note-666> "[I]t all got mixed up in the
public mind and the myth of tartan as a kind of heraldry <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry> became established, not only in the eyes
of outsiders, even the Clansfolk believed it".^[588] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_37-667> On the cusp of the Scottish Renaissance <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Renaissance> and Gaelic Revival <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Revival>, most clans (including major
Lowland families) had been assigned and had generally accepted one or
more tartans by the late 19th century.


      20th century consolidation[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/

Highland dress, kilt in a dark rendition of the Hay and Leith <https://

by the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The first Edwardian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardian_era> book
on the subject (aside from a larger 1906 "library edition" of Whyte as /
The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans with Notes/),^[586] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_20,_197-198-665> was Frank Adam's 1908 /The Clans, Septs &
Regiments of the Scottish Highlands/, which remains in print today
(though in drastically edited form, by Sir Thomas Innes of Learney
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Innes_of_Learney>).^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[589] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_198-668> A
variety of books, with colour plates, had been affordably and widely
published about clan tartans by the mid-20th century. Three popular ones
were /The Clans and Tartans of Scotland/ by Robert Bain, 1938 (the first
to use photographic halftone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone>
prints; revised and updated many times through 1983);^[590]
<#cite_note-669> /The Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland/ by
Innes of Learney (later to become the Lord Lyon King of Arms <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms> as well as a founder of
the Scottish Tartans Society <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Society>),^[591] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_ix-670> 1938,
advancing some clan-tartanry ideas his Lord Lyon predecessor Sir Francis
James Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_James_Grant>
considered "humbug";^[589] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_198-668> and /The
Scottish Clans & Their Tartans/ published by W. & A. K. Johnston, 1945
(later editions re-titled /The Scottish Tartans with Historical
Sketches/, edited by Innes of Learney), and based on previous works by
Grant and Whyte. Many others followed in successive decades.^[388]

The mass-market books (some with over 200 tartans illustrated) did much
to cement the idea of clan tartans in the public imagination, as well as
to consistently anchor particular tartans to particular clans. And the
works were in more general agreement with one another than had been the
Victorian "authorities".^[cb] <#cite_note-672> They also simultaneously
increased the number of clans with their own assigned tartans, and
reduced the number of tartans claimed to be those of certain clans to a
more manageable number, probably after consultation with clan chiefs and
clan society officers. They did, however, typically include sept lists,
which today are widely regarded as bogus^[583] <#cite_note-
Duncan_of_Sketraw-662> (though many present-day clan associations still
use them, as a means of attracting larger membership).

Almost every extant clan (with or without a chief) had at least one
tartan associated with it by this era. Many clans have several well-
accepted tartans. Sometimes they represent different branches of the
family; e.g., there are separate tartans for Campbell <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell> of Breadalbane, Campbell of Cawdor,
and Campbell of Loudoun, in addition to the general "old" Campbell
tartan. In other cases, they are (at least ostensibly) for specific
purposes such as hunting, mourning, formal dress occasions, or Highland
dance competition; e.g., the MacFarlane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_MacFarlane> dress^[593] <#cite_note-673> and hunting tartans^[594]
<#cite_note-674> are different. (See § Tartans for specific purposes
<#Tartans_for_specific_purposes>, below.)

An important, more scholarly work was 1950's /The Setts of the Scottish
Tartans/ by Donald C. Stewart^[595] <#cite_note-675> ^[cc]
<#cite_note-677> (son of the aforementioned D. W. Stewart).^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> The younger Stewart has been hailed as
"the founder of serious tartan research"; originated now-standard
methods for indexing tartans; and would go on to help expose the /
Vestiarium Scoticum/ as a fraud, in /Scotland's Forged Tartans/, co-
authored with J. Charles Thompson in 1980.^[388] <#cite_note-
Newsome_2005-435> ^[597] <#cite_note-678>

In the late 20th century to present, clan and other tartans also have
been catalogued in databases <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database>.
(See § Registration <#Registration>, below.) A small number of new
official clan tartans (mostly specific-purpose "side" tartans, like
dance tartans) were registered in tartan databases in the 21st
century.^[cd] <#cite_note-680>

Regarding modern misrepresentations of clan tartans on historical
figures in films and even museums, Scarlett (1990) wrote: "so widely
have the tartan myths been spread that any script- or guide-book writer
will, in complete ignorance, write the most arrant nonsense and never
think that it might not be true. ... Once false information has been
disseminated by a supposedly authoritative body it is virtually
impossible to correct it."^[599] <#cite_note-681>


      Recognition by clan chiefs[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=21>]

The "officialness" of clan tartans has varied widely, and still does
today. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and assign
it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a
clan's tartan "official" is the chief.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>

Some clans have had no chiefs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Armigerous_clan> for some time, while only a majority subset of those
with living chiefs in the modern era made direct proclamations as to
their clan tartans and registered them with the Lord Lyon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms>.^[ce] <#cite_note-683>
Some time after the launch of the Scottish Register of Tartans <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> (SRT) in 2009, the
Lord Lyon stopped recording clan tartans, deferring to SRT for this
purpose. (See § Registration <#Registration>, below.) Some of the clan
tartans were simply adopted by custom,^[cf] <#cite_note-685> and have
remained rather consistent into the 21st century. A clan booth at a
Highland games <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games> event is
likely to proudly display at least their best-known clan tartan,
regardless whether a chief has declared it official.

However, some chiefs have been quite adamant about what their clan's
legitimate tartans are. Ian Campbell, 12th Duke of Argyll <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Campbell,_12th_Duke_of_Argyll>, chief of Clan
Campbell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell> in the late 20th
century, excoriated attempts to claim there were other than the four
aforementioned particular Campbell tartans (and specifically rejected
the personal-variant tartan of the 6th Duke).^[406] <#cite_note-
Ian_Campbell-454> Similarly, Sir Malcolm MacGregor <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGregor_baronets>, chief of Clan Gregor
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor>, has written that only four
MacGregor tartans (plus a newer dance tartan) are legitimate, out of 10
or more alleged ones found in a tartan database, which he blamed on
"indiscriminate commercialisation ... disingenuous and lead[ing] to
confusion".^[602] <#cite_note-Malcolm_MacGregor-686>

In at least one instance, a clan tartan appears in the coat of arms
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms> of a clan chief and is
considered by the Lord Lyon as the "proper" tartan of the clan: The
crest of the chief of Clan MacLennan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_MacLennan> is /A demi-piper all Proper <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Tincture_(heraldry)#Proper>, garbed in the proper tartan of the
Clan Maclennan/.^[603] <#cite_note-687> ^[cg] <#cite_note-688>

Some chief-authenticated clan tartans are quite late arrivals. In 1961,
the Clan Davidson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Davidson> main
tartan was replaced (and registered with the Lord Lyon) by one of
multiple disputed chiefs, Sir David Davidson of Allt Dinnie, with a
design dating to 1893, in place of an older white-striped version.^[604]
<#cite_note-689> Chief Charles Shaw of Tordarroch <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Shaw_of_Tordarroch> in 1971 replaced the
old Shaw <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Shaw> tartan (a Black Watch
variant based on a misprinted image in Logan & McIan (1847))^[605]

designed in 1969 by D. C. Stewart based on more historical

Clan_Mar> had no approved tartan until Chief Margaret of Mar <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Mar,_31st_Countess_of_Mar> registered
one in 1978 (from a design that may pre-date 1850);^[609]
<#cite_note-694> their dress/red tartan was not adopted until 1992 (from
a design dating to the 18th century).^[83] <#cite_note-SRT_Mar-96> The
MacLeod <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacLeod> red tartan was
approved by Chief John MacLeod of MacLeod <https://en.wikipedia.org/

yellow and blue tartans of the clan; it was based loosely on what
appears in a 1748 portrait of Chief Norman MacLeod <https://

<#cite_note-695> Baron David Lumsden of Cushnie-Lumsden <https://

    Modern general use[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=22>]

Aside from regimental and clan usage, tartan has seen broad (and
sometimes highly politicised) use by the general public in the modern
era. By the 19th century, the Highland romantic revival <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Twilight>, inspired by James Macpherson
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Macpherson>'s "Ossian <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian>" poems and the writings of Sir Walter
Scott <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott>, led to wider
interest in tartan and other things felt to be Gaelic <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaels> and Celtic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Celts_(modern)>. Clubs like the Celtic societies <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_society> welcomed Lowlanders <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Lowlands>, and tartan was rapidly
appropriated <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cultural_appropriation>^[546] <#cite_note-MartinR_54-621> as part of the
Scottish national identity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_national_identity>^[620] <#cite_note-Milne_138-705> ^[621]
<#cite_note-706> (and part of broader British dress as a familiar

The period of widened public interest in tartan and Highland dress after
the repeal of the Dress Act in 1782 has been called the *Highland
Revival*.^[33] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2022-37> ^[ch] <#cite_note-710>
While tartan had already seen more nationwide use from 1707, as a
Scottish nationalism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_nationalism> symbol against union with England <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Union_1707>,^[270] <#cite_note-
BdLC_75-309> it was turned on its ear to become a romanticised symbol of
union loyalism in the early 19th century,^[173] <#cite_note-
Spinning-197> ^[625] <#cite_note-711> an era in which prominent
conflicts caused a patriotic influence of military (including Highland)
style on civilian clothing,^[ci] <#cite_note-714> even among women^[340]
<#cite_note-Tuckett_10-11-385> ^[628] <#cite_note-715> despite its
overtly masculine focus.^[629] <#cite_note-McNeil_83-84-716> ^[630]
<#cite_note-717> ^[166] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189> First among
the northern gentry and later among the common people more broadly,
there was a renewed interest in tartan and Highland dress, despite the
long period of prohibition – largely due to the glory associated with
the Highland regiments' exemplary service in various military
campaigns.^[631] <#cite_note-718> "Highlandism"^[632] <#cite_note-719>
became a romantic, mythologised (even fictionalised) and colourful
escapism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism>^[633] <#cite_note-720>
^[338] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_35-383> even as Lowland Scotland itself
was becoming one of the most industrialised <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Industrialisation> places on earth, and the entire nation was
undergoing the social upheavals of union and empire <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire>, of large-scale warfare, of
urbanisation, and of modernisation during the Scottish Enlightenment
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment>.^[634]
<#cite_note-721> The bloody French Revolution <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/French_Revolution> of 1789–1799 had also helped inspire a British
setting aside of old Stuart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
House_of_Stuart> and Hanoverian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
House_of_Hanover> rivalry.^[635] <#cite_note-722>

Before the clan tartans rush began in 1815, tartan was already being
aggressively marketed to the general public as "fancy" cloth with names
that commemorated famous events and people, even fictional characters
from books and songs, e.g. "Waterloo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Battle_of_Waterloo>", "Flora MacDonald <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Flora_MacDonald>", "Sir Walter Scott", "Wellington <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington>",
"Maggie Lauder <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Sempill>", and
"Meg Merrilees <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Guy_Mannering#Characters>". This inspired a novel perception that
tartans should be named.^[636] <#cite_note-723> Some of the designs by
leading weaver Wilsons of Bannockburn by this period were considered
recognisable on sight.^[637] <#cite_note-724>

In 1822, Maj.-Gen. David Stewart of Garth <https://en.wikipedia.org/

<#cite_note-726> ^[364] <#cite_note-Hinderks_Dziennik_8-409> The
societies liked wearing Highland dress – in their own assimilated, urban
idiom,^[cj] <#cite_note-727> such as tartan frock coats <https://

EsleaMacDonald_2020-10-389>  – and devising new tartans; it has been
suggested that they were engaging in a sort of "internal colonisation",
imposing what they wanted to see rather than simply recording what was
traditionally Highland.^[640] <#cite_note-728> Aside from tartan
fabric's increasing use in non-Highland styles of clothing, Highland
dress itself had already become highly stylized, quite removed from the
simplicity of its peasant origins;^[641] <#cite_note-BdLC_99-100-729>
this was a trend that would continue throughout the later Victorian period.


        The King's jaunt in tartan[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=24>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:George_IV_in_kilt,_by_Wilkie.jpg>David Wilkie <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilkie_(artist)>'s idealised depiction of
George IV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV>, in full Highland
dress <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_dress>, during the visit
to Scotland in 1822^[ck] <#cite_note-731>

The popularity of tartan was greatly increased by the royal visit of
King George IV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Visit_of_George_IV_to_Scotland> of the United Kingdom to Edinburgh in
1822, with other nobles including Lord Mayor of London <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor_of_London> Sir William Curtis <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Curtis,_1st_Baronet>,^[643]
<#cite_note-732> in Highland garb. George was the first reigning monarch
to visit Scotland in 171 years.^[543] <#cite_note-Moncreiffe_24-618> The
pageantry invented for the event, which was nicknamed "the King's
Jaunt", brought a sudden consumer-driven demand for tartan cloth^[492]
<#cite_note-Tuckett_17-560> and made it the national dress <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_dress> of the whole of Scotland.^[543]
<#cite_note-Moncreiffe_24-618> ^[644] <#cite_note-Tuckett_18-733> ^[620]
<#cite_note-Milne_138-705> ^[645] <#cite_note-734> The 21 days of
festivities were organised by the Jacobitism-romanticising but staunchly
unionist^[173] <#cite_note-Spinning-197> Walter Scott, who was another
co-founder of the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, and British military man
Stewart of Garth.^[519] <#cite_note-TBW_Garth-590> They urged Scots
(most of whom were Lowlanders) to attend "all plaided and plumed in
their tartan array"^[646] <#cite_note-Magnusson_653-654-735> in
"complete national costume".^[644] <#cite_note-Tuckett_18-733> One
contemporary writer sarcastically described the pomp that surrounded the
celebrations as "Sir Walter's Celtified Pageantry",^[646] <#cite_note-
Magnusson_653-654-735> ^[647] <#cite_note-736> and another as a "plaided
panorama".^[644] <#cite_note-Tuckett_18-733> Clan chiefs, expected to be
kilted, had little choice but to take the event seriously, and arrived
to show their loyalty in something of a panic, with tartaned retinues of
half a dozen^[265] <#cite_note-BanksdeLaChapell_100-301> to up to 50 per
clan^[648] <#cite_note-BBC_Brown-737> (equipped at great expense, and
with only about a month's official notice), in a city overflowing with
Highlanders, Lowlanders, and English spectators decked in tartan,^[649]
<#cite_note-738> ^[493] <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_30-561> a sight that
Scott's own son-in-law and biographer John Gibson Lockhart <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gibson_Lockhart> called a "Celtic
hallucination".^[491] <#cite_note-BdLC_104-558> Thousands of spectators
attended the many events arranged for the visit.^[265] <#cite_note-
BanksdeLaChapell_100-301> The formal ball, reserved for the gentry,
required Highland dress for admittance, and some 300 tailors were
employed to supply it.^[648] <#cite_note-BBC_Brown-737>

The royal endorsement of tartan and Highland-wear did much to erase any
lingering association of them with the servile peasant class of the
Highlands^[650] <#cite_note-739> (or the region's bands of mountain
bandits, for that matter).^[648] <#cite_note-BBC_Brown-737> Because
Scott had become "the acknowledged preserver of Scotland's past" through
his historical novels, the legend he helped create of tartan and
Highland dress as a Scotland-wide tradition rooted in antiquity was
widely and quickly accepted, despite its ignoring and erasing of
cultural diversity within the country^[641] <#cite_note-BdLC_99-100-729>
(of Gaels, Norse–Gaels <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Norse%E2%80%93Gaels>, Scoto-Normans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scoto-Norman>, and Lowlanders of largely Anglo-Saxon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northumbrian_Old_English> extraction). "A bogus
tartan caricature of [Scotland] had been drawn and accepted, even by
those who mocked it, and it would develop in perspective and
colour."^[651] <#cite_note-740> George IV's visit – which was not just
theatrical but thoroughly political, in marrying Hanoverian power and
loyalty to Stuart ideology and pride^[652] <#cite_note-741>  – has been
described in by Angus Calder <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Angus_Calder> (1994) as the catalyst by which "a Union of practical
convenience became a Union of irrational love and fears, sublimated in
militarism, tartanry, royalism and, eventually imperialism".^[653]
<#cite_note-742> R. Martin (1988) added: "it would seem that this visit
presages the acts of orchestrated political propaganda that we have come
to know very well in the 20th century."^[546] <#cite_note-MartinR_54-621>

Following the royal visit, the tartan industry boomed,^[654]
<#cite_note-743> and the number of available tartans increased
tenfold;^[655] <#cite_note-Armstrong_54-744> in 1822, Wilsons' pattern
book had numbered setts in the hundreds, and introduced many more with
proper names.^[503] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_149-571> Scarlett (1990)
writes that "Tartan was no longer the dress of northern barbarians or
political dissidents; it had become respectable and the garb of loyal
subjects."^[656] <#cite_note-745> Books which documented tartans began
to appear and added to the "tartanry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tartanry>" craze. James Logan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
James_Logan_(writer)>'s romanticised work^[556] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_60-61-632> /The Scottish Gaël/ (1831) was the first such
publication, and led the weaving industry to adopt new patterns, even
Logan's invented or erroneous ones.^[555] <#cite_note-BdLC_106-108-631>

The result of these flurries of attention has been described as an
"astonishing frenzy of excitement into which [patronage of tartanry]
threw the citizens of Edinburgh and much of the rest of Scotland".^[657]

        Civilian spread[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
        title=Tartan&action=edit&section=25>]

From the 1820s, Georgian and then Victorian portraiture of clan nobles
continued the earlier theme of regimentally re-styled Highland dress,
with jewels, gold, and other symbols of aristocracy – a "synthetic
Gaelicism".^[658] <#cite_note-747> The funerals of Sir John Macgregor
Murray <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sir_John_Macgregor_Murray,_1st_Baronet> and Alasdair Ranaldson Macdonell
of Glengarry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Alexander_Ranaldson_Macdonell>, in 1822 and 1823 respectively, were
marked by tartan, bagpipes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Great_Highland_bagpipe>, and "wailing" of clansmen – "a feudal sight in
an increasingly industrial age".^[659] <#cite_note-748> A large public
tartan affair was the 1824 Atholl Gathering <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Atholl_Gathering>^[548] <#cite_note-Armstrong_148-623> (an annual
event that, after a period of abeyance, continues to the present). From
the end of proscription through the Georgian promotion, "distrust of the
Highlands became fascination",^[660] <#cite_note-749> and tartan and
Highland garb "moved from the periphery to the very center, accompanied
by all the processes of forgetting and imaginative re-creation".^[661]
<#cite_note-750> Tartan, no longer the everyday traditional dress of
Highland "barbarians", had become, in altered form, all the rage among
the Scottish upper and even middle classes as formal attire.^[662]
<#cite_note-751> This popularisation of tartan increased its
marketability in the Lowlands, in England, and in the colonies, and
provided a boost to the Scottish textile industry.^[331] <#cite_note-

Tartan had begun making appearances in civilian Georgian fashion
throughout Britain and into continental Europe, as illustrated in
publications such as London's /Gallery of Fashion <https://

Georgian and later Victorian entrepreneurs not only created new tartans,
but new tartan objects called /tartanware/, starting as far back as the
proscription period in the form of wine glasses decorated with tartan
and enamel Jacobite portraits.^[302] <#cite_note-BdLC_84-346> Tartan
decorated an assortment of common household objects, such as snuffboxes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_box#Snuff_box>, jewellery
cases, tableware, sewing accessories, desk items, and even doorknobs and
furniture – a tartan knick-knack market for tourists that continues
through the present in the Highlands.^[675] <#cite_note-764> Visitors to
the Highlands went home with tartanware, and Scotland-based businesses
sent tartanware out as gifts to customers. Some of the more popular
tartans used were the Stewart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Stewart>, MacDonald <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Donald>,
MacGregor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor>, MacDuff <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacDuff>, MacBeth <https://en.wikipedia.org/

<#cite_note-765> ^[677] <#cite_note-766> ^[678] <#cite_note-767> Today,
tartanware is widely collected in England and Scotland.^[679]
<#cite_note-768> There was a symbiotic relationship between tartanware
production and interest in tartans generated by books on the subject: a
tartanware manufacturer from 1820 onward was W. & A. Smith, of Mauchline
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauchline>, also incidentally the
publishers of /Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of
Scotland/ (1850).;^[680] <#cite_note-769> tartanware was sometimes more
specifically called Mauchlinware.^[681] <#cite_note-MartinR_57-770>


      Victorian[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?

Leading up to the beginning of Queen Victoria <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Queen_Victoria>'s reign in 1837, tartan was a brisk trade in
London, Manchester, and other English cities and towns.^[682]
<#cite_note-771> In 1839, the Eglinton Tournament <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eglinton_Tournament>, a medieval re-enactment
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_reenactment> featuring
jousting <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jousting> and a ball <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(dance_party)>, was organised in North
Ayrshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ayrshire> by Archibald
Montgomerie, Earl of Eglinton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archibald_Montgomerie,_13th_Earl_of_Eglinton>; it drew some 100,000
spectators, who had been asked to attend in plaids, and included George
Murray, Duke of Atholl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
George_Murray,_6th_Duke_of_Atholl>, arriving with an entire regiment in
tartan, his newly re-formed Atholl Highlanders <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atholl_Highlanders>^[683] <#cite_note-772> (which
still exists as Europe's last remaining private military force).

        /Vestiarium Scoticum/[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=27>]

The first publication showing colour plates of an array of tartans was
the /Vestiarium Scoticum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vestiarium_Scoticum>/ (meaning 'wardrobe of the Scots'), published in
1842,^[565] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_history-642> and it included a
first: tartans for Lowland families. It was the work of two brothers:
John Carter Allen and Charles Manning Allen, from Surrey <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey>, England, who used a variety of assumed
names. The two implied they were grandsons of Prince Charles Edward
Stuart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart> and
Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Princess_Louise_of_Stolberg-Gedern>, and consequently later became known
as the "Sobieski Stuarts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sobieski_Stuarts>". They claimed further that the /Vestiarium/ was based
on a 1571 manuscript on clan tartans – a manuscript which they never
managed to produce. It was not known at the time, but many of the
tartans were simply invented by the brothers, and others were taken from
early-19th-century sources like the Cockburn and Wilson
collections.^[684] <#cite_note-773> ^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>
The brothers heavily favoured basic checks, or crudely divided checks,
with thin over-checks added; they had an identifiable style of tartans,
assessment of which has varied from "few can be called inspired"^[51]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_47-62> to "quite novel and singularly
gorgeous".^[685] <#cite_note-774> The /Vestiarium/ was followed by their
equally dubious /The Costume of the Clans/ in 1845.^[555] <#cite_note-
BdLC_106-108-631> The books, which "added mystery, romance and some
spurious historical documentation to the subject",^[561] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_61-637> triggered another wave of interest in tartans, and the
enthusiasm generated by these publications led the way for numerous
tartan books in the later 19th century.^[646] <#cite_note-
Magnusson_653-654-735> ^[565] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_history-642>
^[cl] <#cite_note-775>

The sudden availability (and almost unquestioning acceptance) of Lowland
tartans helped spread tartan further in popularity. "The [tartan] cult
was gathering strength and tartan was no longer 'Highland', it had
become 'Scottish'."^[588] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_37-667>

Twenty years after her uncle's royal visit to Scotland, Victoria and her
husband Prince Albert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Albert,_Prince_Consort> made their first trip to the Scottish Highlands
in 1842; she was the first monarch to set foot in the Highlands since
Mary, Queen of Scots <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mary,_Queen_of_Scots>, in the 16th century.^[686] <#cite_note-776> The
visit involved her large royal party being met with several theatrical
tartan-kilted welcomes by Highland nobility and their retinues, with
much sycophantic newspaper fanfare (while the common people were
experiencing considerable misery); the Queen wrote: "It seemed as if a
great chieftain in olden feudal times was receiving his
sovereign".^[687] <#cite_note-777> The monarch's early trips to Scotland
were seen as a royal endorsement and had a transformative effect on the
image of the country, as a now-loyal land of tartan, pipers <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Highland_bagpipe>, and kilted martial
display.^[688] <#cite_note-778>

Victoria and Albert leased Balmoral Castle <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Balmoral_Castle>, in Aberdeenshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Aberdeenshire>, in 1848 (and bought it in 1852)^[689] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2019-06-779> as a private royal demesne <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demesne> and hired a local architect to re-model
the estate in feudalised Scots baronial <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_baronial_architecture> style, starting a "sham-castles"
trend.^[690] <#cite_note-780> Prince Albert personally took care of the
interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the royal
Stewart (red) and the hunting Stewart (green) tartans for carpets, while
using the dress Stewart (red and white) for curtains and
upholstery.^[566] <#cite_note-BdLC_108-643> Prince Albert (who often
wore the kilt at Balmoral) is said to have created the Balmoral tartan,
still used as a royal tartan today.^[691] <#cite_note-781> (See
illustration at § Family and individual <#Family_and_individual>,
below.) They even decorated their carriage <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Carriage> with tartan.^[692] <#cite_note-782> ^[693]
<#cite_note-783> Their adoption of a showy form of Highland dress
inspired adoption by subject "who would have previously left Highland
dress to the festivals of the Scots."^[681] <#cite_note-MartinR_57-770>

The royal couple spent a considerable amount of time at their Scottish
estate (nearly 7 years in total),^[694] <#cite_note-784> ^[cm]
<#cite_note-786> and in doing so hosted "Highland" activities. Victoria
was attended by pipers,^[696] <#cite_note-Armstrong_207-787> and her
children were attired in Highland dress.^[697] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_101-788> Prince Albert himself loved watching the Highland
games <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games>^[698] <#cite_note-
BdLC_108-109-789> and the pair became patrons of the Braemar Gathering
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braemar#Braemar_Gathering>.^[699]
<#cite_note-790> (Support from and attendance by various nobles may have
helped preserve such events to the present, but it also "tartanised"
them permanently, all the way into the 21st century.)^[700]
<#cite_note-791> The royal enthusiasm for and patronage of Highland
things generated more early tourism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Tourism#Emergence_of_leisure_travel> to the Highlands,^[576]
<#cite_note-BdLC_26-654> ^[701] <#cite_note-792> ^[cn] <#cite_note-794>
and a boost to business in the region as far as Perth <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Scotland> and Edinburgh <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh>.^[703] <#cite_note-795> It also spread
tartan-wearing to other northern British lords and ladies, who began to
invent complicated etiquette rules of dress for Highland garb, which had
the effect of increasing the sense that it was upper-class attire.^[173]
<#cite_note-Spinning-197> ^[704] <#cite_note-796> ^[588] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_37-667> (See § Etiquette <#Etiquette>, below.) Adoption of
tartan continued to spread into England; Thomas Osborne, Duke of Leeds
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Osborne,_4th_Duke_of_Leeds>, in
West Yorkshire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Yorkshire>, devised a
livery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livery> tartan for his men in
1848.^[705] <#cite_note-797> Tartan, though a "pseudo-Caledonian
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia> masquerade",^[706]
<#cite_note-798> had become "the stuff of loyalty to the crown",^[707]
<#cite_note-799> with "a spurious royal and aristocratic cachet".^[708]
<#cite_note-800> This royal promotion was also noted abroad, with the
effect that tartan became one of the widest-recognised cultural-identity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity> symbols for the entire
British country.^[709] <#cite_note-801>

Despite their considerable devotion to charity (up to 20% of their Privy
Purse <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Purse> income),^[710]
<#cite_note-802> Victoria and Albert, along with their friends in the
northern gentry, have been accused of using their "Balmorality" – a term
coined by George Scott-Moncrieff <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
George_Scott-Moncrieff> (1932) to refer to upper-class appropriation of
Highland cultural trappings, marked by "hypocrisy" and "false
sentiment" – to trivialise and even fictionalise history.^[711]
<#cite_note-Armstrong_Balmorality-803> According to Fiona K. Armstrong
(2017), they engaged in long-term, tartan-blanketed escapism from the
uncertainties of modernising, industrialised society and from pressing
British societal problems, while worsening those problems in the actual
Highlands.^[711] <#cite_note-Armstrong_Balmorality-803> The queen's
Balmoral residency also had a colonising effect, leading other English
nobility to follow her north and buy property, resulting in land-
ownership disparities that persist to the present.^[712]
<#cite_note-804> The Highlands during Victoria's reign also became more
accessible by road, rail, and boat.^[698] <#cite_note-BdLC_108-109-789>

As the tartan and "romantic Highlands" craze swept over Scotland, the
real Highland population suffered grievously from the Hungry Forties
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Forties> as well as the Highland
Clearances <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Clearances>, when
thousands of Gaelic-speaking Scots from the Highlands and Isles were
evicted by landlords (often the very men who would have been their clan
chiefs) to make way for sheep^[646] <#cite_note-Magnusson_653-654-735>
^[713] <#cite_note-805> and for expansive deer-hunting preserves.^[714]
<#cite_note-806> Scots were also largely disenfranchised from voting,
and the Highlands were running out of young men, in great regimental
demand to fight and die in foreign wars for the empire, and many
emigrating otherwise,^[715] <#cite_note-807> with Victoria and Albert
directly patronising emigration societies <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Highland_and_Island_Emigration_Society>.^[716] <#cite_note-808>
Nearly 2 million Scots moved to non-European destinations during the
Victorian era (more than half the native-born Scottish people of the
period), and took a measure of Highlandism with them^[717]
<#cite_note-809>  – "many of the generally understood images of the
Highlands were held to be 'real' by people at the time".^[718]
<#cite_note-810> This would have strong tartan-promoting results among
the Scottish diaspora <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_diaspora>
later;^[719] <#cite_note-811> Scarlett (1990) calls it a "tartan hunger
that has been abroad from late Victorian times to the present
day".^[720] <#cite_note-812>


        Ripple effects[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
        title=Tartan&action=edit&section=29>]

Thomas Babington Macaulay <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Thomas_Babington_Macaulay> wrote in 1848 of the romantic reinvention of
Highland customs as somehow /generally/ Scottish: "Soon the vulgar
imagination was so completely occupied by plaids <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belted_plaid>, targets <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Targe>, and claymores <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore>,
that, by most Englishmen, /Scotchman/ and /Highlander/ were regarded as
synonymous words."^[721] <#cite_note-813> In 1849, Sir John Graham
Dalyell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham_Dalyell> asserted
that "forty years ago no reputable gentleman would have appeared in a
kilt in the streets of Edinburgh."^[722] <#cite_note-814> Scott-
Moncrieff (1932) likewise wrote of tartans being "misconceived" and worn
all over Scotland (and even England) in the Victorian era as a part of
the Queen's influence.^[723] <#cite_note-815> Increasingly-urban
Scotland was putting on a "rural face"^[724] <#cite_note-816> (a trend
that would continue with "kailyard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kailyard_school>" literature). Tartanry and Highlandism were popular in
part as a counter to a sense (especially among the aristocracy) that
Scotland was losing its separate national identity in the Georgian to
Victorian era, being ever more Anglicised <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Anglicisation> as just "North Britain" amid empire-wide
modernisation.^[725] <#cite_note-817>

Four men in kilts with widely divergent tartans, sporting a variety of
headgear, jackets, plaids, sporrans, and other accessories <https://

In an 1849 letter to a publisher about a planned second edition of /
Vestiarium Scoticum/, John Sobieski Stuart noted that tartan had become
"extensively worn and manufactured" on the continent, as far away as
France, Germany, Bohemia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia>, and
Hungary; he also expressed an interest in working directly with
tartanware and tartan book makers W. & A. Smith of Mauchline.^[726]
<#cite_note-818> The same year, the Duke and Duchess of Atholl <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Murray,_Duchess_of_Atholl> (whose entire
estate was prescribed tartan livery)^[727] <#cite_note-819> hosted a
Highland-dress affair in London, the Royal Caledonian Ball <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Caledonian_Ball>, the first known charity
ball (still a sold-out annual event today).^[728] <#cite_note-820> The

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow>, running out of well <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well> water) was attended by Queen Victoria, with
the Atholl Highlanders (cannon in tow), the Celtic Society of Glasgow,
and an honour-guard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour> unit
called the Glasgow Volunteers putting on a tartan- and piper-laden
display for the newspapers; it was a confluence of modern engineering
and romantic–patriotic tartanry.^[729] <#cite_note-821> When the Prince
Consort died in 1861, Victoria commissioned a tartan-kilted statue of
Albert at Balmoral by William Theed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
William_Theed>.^[730] <#cite_note-822>

According to Jonathan Faiers (2008), Victoria had actually intentionally
made tartan more popular for the benefit of the British textile
industry.^[731] <#cite_note-823> By the 1860s, tartan was not only as
popular in London as in Scotland,^[732] <#cite_note-MartinR_58-824>
leading weaver Wilsons of Bannockburn produced £80,000 of product per
year, and employed 500–600 people. (It amalgamated with another of the
family businesses, a carpet-weaving operation, in 1867, which continued
to 1924.)^[264] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_144-300> Around 1860, new
synthetic aniline dyes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Synthetic_colorant> allowed for production of tartans in vivid colours
at more affordable prices, and their lower cost translated into more
consumption of tartan by the middle class.^[696] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_207-787>

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tartan_Ribbon.jpg>The first
permanent colour photograph, by Thomas Sutton <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Thomas_Sutton_(photographer)> in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon.

As modernisation marched on, the world's first permanent colour
photograph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_photography>, taken by
Thomas Sutton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Thomas_Sutton_(photographer)> (using the three-colour process developed
by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell>) in 1861, was of a tartan ribbon.^[733]
<#cite_note-825> It was created by using red, blue, and yellow filters
to create three photographs which were then combined into a composite.
R. Martin (1988) notes that there was a confluence of unrelated
technological "junctions and serendipities" in the mid-19th century that
together broadly promoted tartan, including photography, consistently
bright and more economical artificial dyes, affordable colour book
printing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_printing#Europe>, mass-
production of soft but durable fine textiles, and applicability of
printed patterns to middle-class products like tartanware – all "far-
removed from the true peasant history of tartan."^[734] <#cite_note-826>
Ian Brown (2012), a professor with a focus on Scottish literature and
culture, has written that while George IV and Victoria (not to mention
business interests in their wake, like the Wilsons of Bannockburn and
the Smiths of Mauchline) seemed to have been "the winner taking over the
loser's tokens", the renewed public interest in tartan within and beyond
Scotland was not entirely owing to them, especially given the
international interest in Highland-romantic works of Walter Scott and
"Ossian". The acceptance of and even enthusiasm for tartan among the
post-proscription upper class can be seen as a necessary attempt at
reconciliation within a culturally diverse country, and the influence
ran both ways, with old Scottish nationalism transmuting into a new
unionism that demanded recognition of Scottish interests and
institutions. "In short, it is an open question whether George IV in a
kilt and Victoria and Albert at Balmoral are appropriating and
subverting a set of values, or whether they are being appropriated and
subverted."^[735] <#cite_note-827> Even the 1822 "King's Jaunt" had been
stage-managed by two Scots with a keen interest in romanticising and
promoting Gaelic and broader Scottish culture (historico-traditional
accuracy notwithstanding),^[641] <#cite_note-BdLC_99-100-729> and the
Atholls' deep and tartan-arrayed involvement in Victoria's activities in
the north can be viewed in the same light.^[736] <#cite_note-828> Both
George IV^[737] <#cite_note-829> ^[738] <#cite_note-830> ^[739]
<#cite_note-831> and Victoria,^[740] <#cite_note-832> primarily of
German House of Hanover <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hanover>
stock, came to identify strongly with their quite thin Scottish House of
Stuart <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart> genealogy.

The 1863 funeral of the Duke of Atholl was another anachronistically
feudal, tartan-and-pipers pageant.^[741] <#cite_note-833> In 1866–1870,
Victoria and the Duchess of Atholl commissioned artist Kenneth MacLeay
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_MacLeay> in Edinburgh to produce
a series of watercolours <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercolour> of
statuesque men in tartan Highland gear, representing common people from
ghillies <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghillie> to shepherds and
fishermen, "as they /now/ are". Prints were published in 1870 as /
Highlanders of Scotland: Portraits Illustrative of the Principal Clans
and Followings, and the Retainers of the Royal Household at Balmoral/,
with text by Amelia (Emily) Murray MacGregor, an attendant of Victoria
as well as a Clan Gregor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor>
historian and the first female Gaelic lecturer. A tartanistical fantasy,
as well as another exercise in "Highlander as noble savage <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_savage>", the art book necessitated
canvassing Scottish aristocrats for outfits and suitable models
("specimens"), as the everyday people did not look the hyper-masculine
part, were not able to afford such Highland-dress extravagances as were
to be illustrated, and were more likely to be wearing trousers than
kilts.^[742] <#cite_note-834> The resulting book is the most detailed
record of the "proper", codified Victorian-era Highland dress and
accessories, which "removed tartan from its blustery nonchalance to an
ordered set of adornments"^[732] <#cite_note-MartinR_58-824>  – most of
which survive to the present, Highland dress being remarkably resistant
to further major stylistic changes, Victorian styles having become
"traditional". Tartan had also become more established throughout the
1850s and 1860s as a textile for European-fashionable rather than
Highland women's clothing, from bodices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bodice> and dresses to sashes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sash> and
shawls (the never-extinguished ladies' plaids).^[732] <#cite_note-
MartinR_58-824> The tartan sash in particular was a favourite of the
Queen,^[732] <#cite_note-MartinR_58-824> and remains a common womenswear
option, worn several different ways in modern Highland dress,^[743]
<#cite_note-835> though it has little to do with original Highland
clothing before the 19th century; it is an adaptation of the plaid to a
style of the European nobility.

In 1871, at the Waverley Ball, a fancy dress <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Costume_party#Nineteenth_century> affair in London, the Prince of
Wales (the future King Edward VII <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Edward_VII>) and his brother Prince Arthur <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Prince_Arthur,_Duke_of_Connaught_and_Strathearn>, long accustomed
to Highland dress, arrived tartaned out as an old-time Lord of the Isles
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Isles> and as Bonnie Prince
Charlie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Stuart>,
respectively.^[744] <#cite_note-836> In 1872, ethnologist <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnology> Jacob Falke wrote that "In Scotland
indeed the plaid has still some importance, but it is an object of
manufacture, and ... its motives have long ago become the common
property of fashion, and indeed have become so permeated by it that what
is genuine and old in it is scarcely to be recognised".^[745]
<#cite_note-837> Since its 1880 re-opening, the Gaelic Society of Perth
in the Lowlands held festivities that involved much piping and tartan-
wear, into the early 20th century, despite the language-preservation
organisation having nothing to do with Highland dress or /pibroch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pibroch>/; being swathed in tartan had
somehow become vital to such events.^[746] <#cite_note-838> By 1883,
Highland dress as proper courtly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Royal_court> attire had become highly regulated, aristocratic, and
formal, but "inclusive" in one sense – the tartan-wear was permitted at
court for essentially anyone claiming Highland origins or land-ownership
(even if natively English), not just the gentles of the well-established
clans.^[747] <#cite_note-839>

In the Victorian era, tartan garments for women as well as men continued
to be featured in fashion catalogues, in styles not derived from
Highland costume, such as everyday suits and dresses.^[576] <#cite_note-
BdLC_26-654> Tartan had also become popular for children's clothing in
continental Europe,^[748] <#cite_note-840> inspired by the royal
children of Victoria.^[749] <#cite_note-841> In the United States,
tartan was similarly worked into school uniforms, especially at Catholic
schools <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_school_uniform>.^[750]
<#cite_note-842> The late 19th century saw tartan (sometimes in silk) in
fashion throughout Europe, including in France (e.g. Paris, Lyon, and
Alsace) and Italy,^[751] <#cite_note-843> and as far from Britain as
Russia.^[752] <#cite_note-Kirsanova-844> (See c. 1855 French master

In the Edwardian era <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwardian_era>,
tartan had become less a component of men's clothing (with the decline
in kilt-wearing) but more an important part of women's fashion,^[77]
<#cite_note-Scarlett1990_40-89> including fanciful /haute couture
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture>/ designs from Paris
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fashion#Paris> that had no
connection to Highland style,^[576] <#cite_note-BdLC_26-654> and many
accessories such as petticoats <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Petticoat>, stockings <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockings>, and
blouses <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blouse>; masculine accessories
included braces (suspenders) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspenders>,

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cummerbund>, and socks.^[77] <#cite_note-

Edward VII <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII> himself had grown
up wearing Highland dress frequently.^[697] <#cite_note-
Armstrong_101-788> There was also in this period into the 1920s a market
for Highland-dress etiquette booklets, which tied into the era's "dress
sense" of decorum and class^[415] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_162-467> (see
also § Etiquette <#Etiquette>, below). Because of its associations with
the British aristocracy, Scottish clans, and Highland military, tartan
had developed an air of dignity and exclusivity.^[754] <#cite_note-
BdLC_26-27-846> Because of this, tartan was to make periodic resurgences
in the world of fashion. The tartan uniforms of the Scottish Regiments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Regiments> were an important
recruiting tool during World War I; as Archibald Primrose, Lord Rosebery
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Archibald_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery>, put it: "there is nothing so
magnificent in our army as the swing of a kilted regiment".^[755]
<#cite_note-847> Tartan's Georgian re-orientation as a symbol
representing unionism and empire continued well into the first half of
the 20th century,^[756] <#cite_note-848> though outright tartanry and
Highlandism on the part of the upper class waned, especially after about
1920.^[757] <#cite_note-849> Nevertheless, Edward VIII <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII>, later Duke of Windsor, was a life-
long devotee of tartan, often wearing more than one at a time.^[576]

entertainment platform of tartan Highland dress, a thick Scots <https://

idealised, rural Scotland, like his hit "Roamin' in the Gloamin'
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roamin%27_in_the_Gloamin%27>". At one
point, he was the highest-paid performer in the world, and toured the
United States, Australia, South Africa, and of course the UK to sold-out
audiences. A Lowlander himself, Lauder has been credited with (and
blamed for) keeping alive a tartanry-and-Highlandism image of Scotland,
with critics calling him a "kilted clown" who promoted the idea of
Scotsmen "clothed like the chieftain of Clan McCrazy".^[759]

        Disaspora and globalisation[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=31>]

By the mid-20th century,^[760] <#cite_note-852> annual Highland games
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_games> events, modelled on the
traditional events in Scotland, had been established not just in
Scotland but throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, and South Africa, among other places with a notable Scottish
diaspora <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_diaspora>, which totals
about 50 million people worldwide.^[761] <#cite_note-853> There are
dozens of such events in Scotland,^[762] <#cite_note-Armstrong_264-854>
and at least 260 annual Highland games events worldwide as of
2000,^[763] <#cite_note-855> more than 100 of them in the US alone, and
dozens more in Canada.^[762] <#cite_note-Armstrong_264-854> They are
closely intertwined with bagpipe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Great_Highland_bagpipe> band competitions (which date to 1781), a
lasting source of tartan imagery in their regiment-inspired Highland
uniforms.^[764] <#cite_note-856>

Tartan Day <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Day>, an annual
symbolic ethnicity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_ethnicity>
holiday among the Scottish diaspora, is a growing affair celebrated on 6
April, the date on which the Declaration of Arbroath <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Arbroath> was signed in 1320.
Tartan Day was first declared in Nova Scotia <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Nova_Scotia> in 1987, and was essentially nation-wide in Canada by
the 1990s. It has since spread to Australia (with varying levels of
official recognition, 1989–1996), the US (1998), and other places
including New Zealand,^[768] <#cite_note-860> and even Argentina^[769]
<#cite_note-861> and Paris, France.^[770] <#cite_note-
SRT_Brittany_National-862> In New York City <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/New_York_City>, it has turned into an entire Tartan Week since
1999, with honorary "grand marshals" that are usually Scottish
celebrities.^[771] <#cite_note-863>

The term /tartanism/ (as distinct from /tartanry/) has been coined by
Ian Brown (2012) for this international tokenisation of tartan as an
ethnic-identity <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity> symbol,
evolving to some degree independently to suit diasporic cultural needs
and unrestrained by the views of the originating Scottish "home"
culture.^[772] <#cite_note-864> According to Ian Maitland Hume (2001),
tartan and the kilt are powerful symbols that "encapsulate many facets
of a heritage which people aspire to access ... a part-mythical family
origin for those seeking roots".^[773] <#cite_note-865>

The Scottish Tartans Museum and Heritage Center <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Museum_and_Heritage_Center> was
opened by the Scottish Tartans Society <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Society> in 1988 in Highlands, North Carolina <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlands,_North_Carolina>; in 1994, it moved to
nearby Franklin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Franklin,_North_Carolina>. The museum, which runs independently of STS,
features over 600 tartans on display, including specimens dating to
c. 1725, and Highland dress examples to ca. 1800.^[774] <#cite_note-866>
(STS also operated a Scottish Tartans Museum in Edinburgh,^[775]
<#cite_note-867> but it closed when STS did in 2000.) A major exhibition
on tartan was produced by the Fashion Institute of Technology <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Institute_of_Technology> in New York 1988–
89, and another was created for the Edinburgh Festival <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival> in 1989.^[776]
<#cite_note-868> Others followed in Italy in 2003, and Japan in
2018.^[777] <#cite_note-869> In April 2023, the Victoria and Albert
Museum of Dundee (V&A Dundee <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
V%26A_Dundee>) opened a design exhibit (running until January 2024)
about tartan and its "shifting context", with goals of "challenging
preconceptions of what tartan is, whether that be from a historical
sense or fashion sense".^[778] <#cite_note-870> ^[779] <#cite_note-871>

D. Gordon Teall of Teallach, of the Scottish Tartans Society, observed
in 1994:^[780] <#cite_note-872>

    Tartans have always formed part of Scotland's historic heritage and
    it is a compliment to their country that they have become so
    widespread throughout the English and Gaelic speaking world. They
    are probably more popular now than they have ever been because they
    have come to symbolise the spirit of families, clans and districts
    and, more recently, corporate institutions.

Even as tartan has been bent to the cultural needs of the diaspora, as
"the most straightforward and outward sign of ... affinity with
Scottishness", and bent to the commercial intents of fashion, tourism,
entertainment, and other industries, tartan's reception by native Scots
in Scotland has been less favourable for decades, even the last century
or so. Reasons include a feeling that it is not really a symbol of broad
Scottish national identity because of its specifically Gaelic and
Highland origin; the "Highlandist" and imperialist foisting of it on the
entire country as national costume in the late Georgian through
Victorian eras; distorted views of Scottish people promulgated by Lauder
and other tartaned entertainers of a century ago; an academic view of
tartary and Lowland kailyard literature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Kailyard_literature> as two halves of a low-brow, romanticising
vulgarity (reinforced in recent decades by the "Tartan Army <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army>" fandom of the Scotland national
football team reinvigorating a working-class attachment to kilts and
tartan); and historically inaccurate portrayal of Scotland by tartan-
heavy Hollywood productions like /Brigadoon/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Brigadoon_(film)> (1954) and /Braveheart <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Braveheart>/ (1995).^[781] <#cite_note-873> Brancaz (2016) argues
that "looking at tartan through the lens of the intelligentsia fails to
account for its enduring appeal and resilience. ... [T]he wearing of
kilts and tartans at weddings, funerals, and /cèilidhs <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A8ilidh>/ in Scotland has increasingly been
interpreted as a form of cultural reappropriation."^[782] <#cite_note-874>


        Industry and politics[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
        index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=32>]

In 2006, the British Ministry of Defence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)> sparked controversy when it
allowed foreign woollen mills to bid for the government contracts to
provide the tartans used by the Scottish troops (newly amalgamated as
battalions into the Royal Regiment of Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Regiment_of_Scotland>), and lowered the
formerly very high standards for the cloth.^[214] <#cite_note-
Newsome_Black_Watch-243>

Following a bill <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_member%27s_bill>
submitted in the Scottish Parliament <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Parliament> in February 2007,^[783] <#cite_note-whatsNew-875>
Scotland's enterprise minister <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Deputy_Minister_for_Enterprise_and_Lifelong_Learning> announced in July
2007 that the National Archives of Scotland <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/National_Archives_of_Scotland> would set up a national register of
tartans.^[784] <#cite_note-Mather_MacKenzie-876> The announcement stated
that "Tartan's importance to Scotland cannot be overestimated. It is
deeply embedded in Scottish culture and is an internationally recognised
symbol of Scotland."^[784] <#cite_note-Mather_MacKenzie-876> This was
later reiterated in 2013 through the BBC.^[785] <#cite_note-877> The
ministry cited an industry report indicating that "the tartan industry
is a significant contributor to the overall Scottish economy <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland>; and larger ... than
suggested by previous industry estimates", and is the basis for some 200
businesses, 4,000 jobs, and £350 million in annual GDP <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product> in Scotland.^[784]
<#cite_note-Mather_MacKenzie-876> The bill passed in October 2008, and
the Scottish Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> launched in February 2009.^[783]

tartan-pattern clothing shot up in popularity again starting around 2010

/The Observer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer>/ reported in
2010 that tartan clothing had become more popular than ever before,
crossing subcultural, social-class, and age-group lines, and showing in
that year a 540% sales increase in Britain from only two years
earlier.^[786] <#cite_note-878> Around the same time, there began a
resurgence in tartan kilt wearing among Scottish young people "as a mark
of a vibrant, modern Scotland".^[787] <#cite_note-879> ^[788]
<#cite_note-PatersonMB_172-880> ^[789] <#cite_note-Armstrong_274-881>
^[790] <#cite_note-Cheape2012_14-882> This has interrupted a
generations-long trend of native Scottish disaffection toward tartan as
stereotyping kitsch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch>.^[791]
<#cite_note-883> ^[792] <#cite_note-884> An online survey by BBC
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC> in 2012 found that 52% of
respondents strongly or very strongly disagreed with the premise "Walter
Scott's re-branding of all Scots as tartan-wearing Highlanders has been
a hindrance to Scotland's cultural development", and only a third
agreed.^[793] <#cite_note-885> Tartan in mainstream, international
fashion experienced another resurgence starting in 2019.^[794]
<#cite_note-886>

Contemporary Scottish nationalism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_nationalism> has been said to be "fed, in part, by tartan and
Jacobite nostalgia".^[795] <#cite_note-887> After avoidance of tartan
since the 1970s (especially by Scottish liberals <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism>),^[796] <#cite_note-888> the cloth has
been politicised again as a nationalist symbol (as it was in the early
18th century), especially during the 2014 Scottish independence
referendum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
2014_Scottish_independence_referendum> and in the Scottish National
Party <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party>'s 2015
campaign.^[789] <#cite_note-Armstrong_274-881> (Perhaps owing to this
messaging shift, the VisitScotland agency around the same time changed
its tourism advertising to minimise, though not eliminate, tartan
imagery.)^[797] <#cite_note-889> Murray Pittock <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Pittock> (2002) writes that the neo-
Jacobitism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Jacobite_Revival> is "both
irritating kitsch and a language of identity" for modern Scots.^[798]
<#cite_note-890> After several decades of intellectual hostility toward
tartan (e.g. in Tom Nairn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Nairn>'s
1977 /The Break-up of Britain: Crisis and Neo-nationalism/, and Hugh
Trevor-Roper <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Trevor-Roper>'s
posthumous 2008 /The Invention of Scotland/), an "academic re-assessment
of tartan" began in the early 21st century, relying on a wider range of
early and modern source material,^[799] <#cite_note-891> in

Carol Craig (2003) writes: "Like it or not, tartan is a very
sophisticated branding and marketing tool for Scotland."^[817]
<#cite_note-909> In a tartan-as-marketing analysis, Paterson (2001)
observed that continued internationalisation of tartan manufacture,
design, and consumption has diluted the associative "Scottishness" of
tartan and its value as a national identifier. He blames this in part on
Scottish weavers' failure to adapt to market demands for a wider range
of fabric applications, as well as the businesses' own complicity in
broadening tartan's perceived cultural identity, e.g. in creating
tartans for non-Scottish families, places, and organisations.^[818]

In 1947, the tartan-laden Broadway musical /Brigadoon <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon>/ (followed by a film version <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon_(film)> in 1954 and a television
adaptation in 1966) renewed an excessively romanticised notion of the
Highlands and Highland dress. A critical review called it a "whimsical
dream-world" that was "overloaded with Hollywood-Scottish
trappings".^[819] <#cite_note-911> (The production is generally not well
received by actual Scots.)^[820] <#cite_note-912> ^[821] <#cite_note-

Tartan suits were popular in the mod subculture <https://

Since the 1970s, the fandom of the Scotland men's national football
(soccer) team <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

to by the nickname "Tartan Army <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

kilts) at matches.

Tartan became a common element of punk subculture <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture> starting in the late 1970s. Punk
music <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock> was a way for youth in
the British Isles to voice their discontent with the ruling class
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_class> and with modern society.
The unorthodox use of tartan (especially the royal Stewart <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Stewart_tartan>), which had long been
associated with authority and gentility <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Gentry>, was then seen as an expression of that discontent. In this way,
tartan – worn unconventionally – became an anti-establishment <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment> symbol. This was entirely on
purpose according to Vivienne Westwood <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Vivienne_Westwood>, a designer deeply involved in early punk
fashion;^[754] <#cite_note-BdLC_26-27-846> ^[823] <#cite_note-915> the
idea was "to seize the very fabric of the Establishment in order to
reverse its meaning and perhaps to challenge society's design."^[824]
<#cite_note-MartinR_59-916> American punks often wore tartan skirts, a
"subversion" of the Catholic school-girl uniform, and kilts have also
been worn in the punk scene since the late 1970s, especially in the
UK.^[790] <#cite_note-Cheape2012_14-882> Baggy tartan pants later proved
popular among pop-punks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk> and
skate punks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skate_punk>, and tartan-lined
jackets among ska punks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska_punk>. (For
further information, see Punk fashion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Punk_fashion>.) From the late 1990s, kilts (mostly modernised "utility
kilts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_kilt>" but sometimes
traditional ones) have become relatively popular even in North American
post-punk subculture (e.g. the goth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Goth_subculture>–industrial <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Industrial_music>, emo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emo>, and
steampunk <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk> scenes), though
often in black rather than tartan.

After the 1970s, Westwood, who continued to work extenstively with
tartan, was joined by other big-name /couturiers/. These included Ralph
Lauren <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren> and Laura Ashley
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ashley>, whose designs promoted
tartan as a mainstream modern clothing option "with traditional grace
and style" for both women and men;^[800] <#cite_note-BdLC_33-892> ^[824]
<#cite_note-MartinR_59-916> Stephen Sprouse <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Stephen_Sprouse>,^[824] <#cite_note-MartinR_59-916> credited with a
1980s combination of "uptown sophistication in clothing with a downtown
punk and pop sensibility";^[825] <#cite_note-917> and later Alexander
McQueen <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McQueen>,^[826]
<#cite_note-918> who was "consciously repoliticising the cloth".^[308]
<#cite_note-NatGeo-352> Others have included Jean Paul Gaultier
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Paul_Gaultier>, Tommy Hilfiger
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hilfiger> (who made tartan central
to his fall 2000 collection), Christian Lacroix <https://

Tartan/plaid flannel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannel> shirts,
emblematic of the working class, re-entered mainstream fashion through a
series of subcultural <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture>
adoptions, originating primarily in the western United States. First,
the style became a staple of cholo <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cholo_(subculture)> style in and around Los Angeles, from the 1970s.
From there, the style later became adopted by hip hop fashion <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_fashion> in the 1990s, especially the West
Coast hip hop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_hip_hop>
lifestyle.^[829] <#cite_note-921> Tartan flannel shirts also became
quintessentially part of (and androgynous within) the grunge <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge> scene (starting in Seattle) of the late
1980s to 2000s.^[830] <#cite_note-922> There was fashion cross-
pollination between these youth-culture movements,^[831]
<#cite_note-923> and the fashion industry has found this confluence very
marketable.^[832] <#cite_note-924>

A resurgence of interest in tartan and kilts (and even Scottish
tourism)^[821] <#cite_note-Herald_Hollywood-913> ^[833] <#cite_note-925>
has been generated in recent times by major Hollywood productions^[834]

    Popular designs[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=34>]

One of the most popular tartans is the royal Stewart <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Stewart_tartan>, ostensibly the personal
tartan of the British monarch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_British_monarchs>, since George IV declared it his own (though
it was probably designed by the Sobieski Stuarts <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobieski_Stuarts>,^[689] <#cite_note-
EsleaMacDonald_2019-06-779> albeit based on mid-18th-century pattern
called "Prince Charles Edward Stuart").^[112] <#cite_note-SRT_PCES-129>
^[64] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2016-01-76> The "royal" sett was first
published in 1831 in the book /The Scottish Gaël/ by James Logan. In
addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, royal
Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish shortbread
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortbread>,^[849] <#cite_note-941> and
it has also long been favoured by the British punk <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture> scene.

Another tartan in very common use by the general public is Black Watch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Watch> (also known as old Campbell
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell>, Grant <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Grant> hunting, and Government).^[128]
<#cite_note-MacDonald1995_48-145> This tartan, a dark variant (and
ancestor) of the main Clan Campbell tartan, has long been used by
military units in the British Army <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
British_Army> and other Commonwealth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Commonwealth_of_Nations> forces.

Early manufacturer Wilsons of Bannockburn made many "fashion", "fancy",
or "national" tartans with catalogue numbers or fanciful names, without
any association with particular families, districts, or organisations;
two popular ones still in use are both usually called "Caledonia".
Wilsons No. 3 is found in their 1819 /Key Pattern Book/ and is
comparatively simple,^[850] <#cite_note-SRT_468-942> while No. 144 is
more complex, though of a similar colour scheme, and seems to date to
the late 18th century.^[851] <#cite_note-943> (The numbering suggests
the other does as well.) Some other tartans in this "Caledonia" group
were later claimed by clans; e.g. Caledonia No. 43 or "Kidd" became one
of the MacPherson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacPherson>
tartans.^[852] <#cite_note-944> ^[850] <#cite_note-SRT_468-942>

In the general fashion industry, various patterns are technically tartan
but are not treated as tartan/s/ in the clan or district sense. The very
basic red-and-black Rob Roy or Robert Roy MacGregor pattern, the oldest
of the Clan Gregor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor> setts
(though named after Rob Roy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Rob_Roy_MacGregor> in the Victorian period),^[853] <#cite_note-945> is
also in broad use (often with changed colours) as one of the most common
patterns used in flannel <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannel> cloth
for clothing and bedding; in the US, it is often called "buffalo
plaid",^[854] <#cite_note-946> a term of uncertain derivation.^[855]
<#cite_note-947> When the Rob Roy sett is changed to a white ground with
any other colour this forms the most common gingham <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingham> cloth style. Gingham is often given a
wider setting, to form a lattice appearance (sometimes called
"windowpane plaid" or "windowpane check").^[856] <#cite_note-
Schlueter-948> When that pattern is given one or more additional over-
check colours, the result is the pattern known as tattersall <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattersall_(cloth)>.^[856] <#cite_note-Schlueter-948>

LGBT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT>-themed modern "fashion" tartans

In addition to clan tartans, many tartan patterns have been developed
for individuals, families, districts and towns, institutions,
corporations, and events.^[1] <#cite_note-Newsome_1994-1> They have even
been created for particular religious and ethnic groups <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group>,^[co] <#cite_note-954> and for
sociological groups like the LGBT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT>
community.^[788] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_172-880> ^[862] <#cite_note-955>
Tartan has had a long history with the military, and today some military
units – particularly those within the Commonwealth <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations> – have tartan dress
uniforms.^[863] <#cite_note-956> (See List of tartans § UK military or
government tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_tartans#UK_military_or_government_tartans>.)


      Regional[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=36>]

Many districts, cities, and towns in Scotland have their own tartans,
mostly dating to the 20th century (though some few district tartans are
quite old),^[cp] <#cite_note-957> and not always official; many were
just created for marketing to tourists,^[864] <#cite_note-958> and some
are copyrighted works tied to specific vendors.^[865] <#cite_note-
Newsome_2008-959> They are intended primarily for those to whom a clan
tartan does not seem to apply (see § Etiquette <#Etiquette>, below). At
least two local government councils in Scotland <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Scotland> have official
tartans.^[866] <#cite_note-960>

A tartan with wide bands of green and red, and narrower bands of grey
and yellow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maple_leaf_tartan.png>The
Maple Leaf tartan, designed in 1964,^[867] <#cite_note-961> has been an
official symbol of Canada since 2011.^[868] <#cite_note-DCH-962>

In addition to the traditional district and modern geographic tartans of
Scotland, new designs have been created for places in other countries.
Only some regional tartans are officially recognised by the government
bodies of the places the designs represent.

The pan-Celticism <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Celticism> movement
has inspired the creation of "national" (in the sense of Celtic nations
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_nations>) and sometimes regional
tartans "to emphasise the ... bonds with other Celtic countries"^[869]
<#cite_note-SRT_Welsh_National-963> outside of Scotland; none of these
appear to have any official recognition. There are tartans of Cornwall
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Cornish_kilts_and_tartans#National_tartans>, long a part of Devonshire
in England (designed from 1963 to the 1980s);^[cq] <#cite_note-970>
Wales <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales> (from 1967 onward^[cr]
<#cite_note-975>  – sometimes with false claims of antiquity by
marketers);^[880] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-04-976> the Isle of Man
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man> (from 1946, many by D. G.
Teall of the Scottish Tartans Society, and several asymmetric);^[cs]
<#cite_note-988> Brittany <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany> in
France (from 2002);^[ct] <#cite_note-991> Galicia <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia,_Spain> in Spain (from 1990);^[cu]
<#cite_note-995> and especially Ireland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Ireland> (from 1956).

After the discovery of the "Dungiven tartan" (see § 16th century
<#16th_century>, above) and its marketing as a district tartan for
Ulster, Scottish weavers (and in two cases English, and in another
American) decided to tap an Irish and especially Irish-American market
by introducing a profusion of national, province, and county tartans for
Ireland and Northern Ireland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Northern_Ireland>, generally based on established Scottish tartans with
some colour changes.^[19] <#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> ^[205]
<#cite_note-Newsome_disguise-233> These geographical tartans, which
(aside from the Dungiven/Ulster reconstruction of 1956) date to 1970 and
later,^[209] <#cite_note-Newsome_rethinking-237> do not have any
official recognition, and are purely a product of the industry.^[19]
<#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> ^[203] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_182-231>
One weaver even introduced a competing set of Irish national and county
tartans in 1996, different from the previous offerings.^[203]
<#cite_note-PatersonMB_182-231> "The influence of native Irish people,
either as suppliers or consumers of Irish tartans, would appear to be
minimal."^[19] <#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21>

Further afield, all but two Canadian provinces and territories <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada> have official
tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_tartans_of_Canada>, with
the first dating from 1956. Neither Quebec <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Quebec> nor Nunavut <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut>,
Canada's newest territory, have formally adopted patterns. Alberta
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta>, meanwhile, has two official
tartans, including a dress one. All but Quebec's were registered with
the Court of the Lord Lyon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Court_of_the_Lord_Lyon> in Scotland.^[897] <#cite_note-996> Canada has
an official national tartan that was originally designed to commemorate
the introduction of its new maple leaf flag, and was made an official
national emblem in 2011.^[868] <#cite_note-DCH-962> Various Canadian
regions (like Labrador <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador> and Cape
Breton Island <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Breton_Island>),
counties, municipalities, and institutions also have official
tartans.^[cv] <#cite_note-999>

Tartans have been created for Australia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
District_tartans_of_Australia>; its capital city, Canberra <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra>; each of its states <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Australia>; and some of its local
government areas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Local_government_in_Australia>; but only some of those tartans have been
officially adopted or recognised by the relevant governments in
Australia. US states <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_states> have
official tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
List_of_U.S._state_tartans>, with the first dating from 1988.


      Hunting, mourning, dress, and dance[edit <https://
      en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=37>]

wiki/Aboyne_dress> with dance tartans that feature a lot of white

A tartan is sometimes differentiated from another with the same name by
a label: /hunting/, /mourning/, /dress/, or /dance/. The first three of
these ideas are the result of Victorian fondness for dress etiquette and
show^[900] <#cite_note-1000> (and weaver marketing);^[67] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_42-79> the last is more recent.

*Hunting tartans* tend to be made up of subdued colours, such as dark
blues, greens, and browns.^[901] <#cite_note-1001> Although there is
some evidence of early tartans with camouflage colours going back to the
16th century, hunting tartans, despite the name, have very little to do
with actual hunting.^[12] <#cite_note-STM_faq-12>

*Mourning tartans*, though quite rare, are associated with death and
funerals. They are usually designed using combinations of black and
white, or by replacing bright colours such as reds and yellows in a
traditional tartan with black, white, or grey.^[902] <#cite_note-1002>

*Dress tartans* are usually special tartans for formal-dress <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_tie> occasions^[903] <#cite_note-1003> (e.g.
dress Stewart^[904] <#cite_note-1004> is distinct from both the main
royal Stewart tartan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Royal_Stewart_tartan> and the hunting Stewart,^[905] <#cite_note-1005>
among several other tartans attributed to Stewart/Stuart <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Stewart>). In a few cases, a dress tartan is
simply the main tartan of the clan.^[cw] <#cite_note-1010> Dress tartans
that do differ from main clan tartans are sometimes entirely different
(e.g. MacMillan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacMillan>^[37]
<#cite_note-SRT_MacMillan-44> and MacMillan dress^[910]
<#cite_note-1011> are unrelated designs), while in most cases they are
based on the main tartan but with colour differences (e.g. Stewart).
Some dress tartans are very modern,^[83] <#cite_note-SRT_Mar-96> ^[612]
<#cite_note-SRT_MacTavish-697> but some date back to the era of the /
Vestiarium Scoticum/.^[911] <#cite_note-1012>

*Dance tartans*, intended for Highland dance <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Highland_dance> outfits, for either sex, are inspired (like most
dress tartans before them) by the arisaid <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Arisaid> (/earasaid/ tartans thought to have been worn by Highland
women in the 17th and 18th centuries, which often featured white as a
major colour, as do typical dance tartans today (most or all of which
date to the 20th century or later). Some dance tartans are named
"arisaid" rather than "dance", e.g. Fraser <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Clan_Fraser> arisaid.^[912] <#cite_note-1013> ^[cx] <#cite_note-1015>

There has been some confusion between dress and dance tartans,
especially since the idea of the latter developed from the former.^[cy]
<#cite_note-1017> Most dress tartans, including some of the oldest, also
have white in them, and have been used for dance competition in lieu of
a dance-specific tartan, so are easy to mistake for dance tartans, which
almost invariably have white in them.^[915] <#cite_note-SRT_dance-1018>
^[cz] <#cite_note-1019>


      Family and individual[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=38>]

A large proportion of non-clan tartans in all of the modern tartan
databases have always been family tartans, promulgated mostly from the
late 20th century for family names that are not clans or listed as septs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sept#Scotland> of clans. These are
usually Scottish surnames, but the /Scottish Register of Tartans
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Register_of_Tartans>/ (/SRT/)
database increasingly includes new family tartans for names that are not
Scottish or even British. Most family tartans have no copyright claim,
since they are intended for use by anyone with the surname or an
extended-family connection. The /SRT/ classifies them together with clan
tartans in a "clan/family" category if they have history that pre-
dates /SRT/ or if they are newer and are approved by a legally
recognized clan chief or family head, but in a "name" category if they
are newer and lack such imprimatur.

A tartan that is predominantly two-tone grey with thin black and red
stripes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Balmoral_tartan.jpg>The
British royal family <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
British_royal_family>'s own Balmoral tartan (designed c. 1852). It is
incidentally one of the few long-established tartans with multiple hues
of the same colour (two greys, in this case).

A few non-clan family tartans have an older pedigree. The best known is
Balmoral tartan, reserved for the British royal family <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family> and personal pipers
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Highland_bagpipe> thereof, since
its creation by Prince Albert <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Albert,_Prince_Consort> c. 1852.^[da] <#cite_note-1021> (See also
further discussion under § Etiquette <#Etiquette>, below.) Some clans
recognise tartans for specific family branches and septs that are not
themselves generally regarded as clans. For example, Clan Robertson/
Donnachaidh/Duncan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Robertson>
acknowledges separate, established tartans (some of them quite old) for
Inches, MacGlashan, MacInroy, MacLagan, MacPhee, MacWilliam, Reid, and
Robinson,^[917] <#cite_note-1022> and they are all registered in the /SRT/.

Since the late 1960s, various weavers have marketed (primarily to Irish
Americans) some tartans with Irish family names, without any involvement
by family members.^[205] <#cite_note-Newsome_disguise-233> There had
also been a legend that the rare /Clans Originaux/ (1880) contained
Irish family tartans, but this was finally disproven in 2003.^[19]
<#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21> ^[db] <#cite_note-1024> There is one
case of a formal Irish clan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_clan>/
family tartan, however: The Clan Cian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Clan_Cian> Society commissioned a tartan for Cian of Ely <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ile>, and registered it with the Chief
Herald of Ireland <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Chief_Herald_of_Ireland> in 1983.^[19] <#cite_note-Newsome_Wilkinson-21>
^[205] <#cite_note-Newsome_disguise-233> (Even this has an Irish-
American connection, as the chief resided in California, and the society
is US-headquartered.)^[919] <#cite_note-1025> Similarly, a commercial
operation in Cardiff <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff> named Wales
Tartan Centre (supplied by Cambrian Woollen Mill <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_Woollen_Mill>) has since the early 2000s
promoted a long series of tartans named for common or prominent Welsh
family names; they are unusual in often having odd-numbered thread
counts, and having a different warp and weft <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Warp_and_weft> (producing rectangular rather than square patterns),
probably to distinguish them from the Scottish style.^[880] <#cite_note-
Newsome_2005-04-976> ^[920] <#cite_note-1026>

For the much narrower sense of /family/ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Nuclear_family>, the /SRT/ registers also as "name" tartans those that
are created by individuals for only themselves and their immediate-
family members, often for weddings; these usually have a copyright
claim. One of the earliest tartans named for a specific person^[dc]
<#cite_note-1027> is the "Janet Wilson sett", entered into the late
1770s records of Wilsons of Bannockburn and believed to refer to the
company founder's wife or daughter-in-law, though made as one of their
publicly available patterns.^[306] <#cite_note-Tuckett_6-350> ^[dd]
<#cite_note-1030>


      Corporate and commercial[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=39>]

Numerous Scottish brands use tartan, and some have unique tartans.
Various not-for-profit organisations also have corporate tartans.
Probably the earliest case was that of the Ancient Caledonian Society of
London (founded in 1786 and defunct since 1837), which used what is
believed to have been a consistent tartan^[923] <#cite_note-1031> for
its members' frock coats <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frock_coat>
(which, unusually, featured brocade <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Brocade> woven into the tartan, of Jacobite <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Jacobitism> white roses – it may be what 1767 advertisements called
"flowered tartan"); only one known example of the coat survives.^[344]

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_(2012_film)>/

The "corporate" category is one of the fastest-growing in the official /
Scottish Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans>/ (/SRT/) database, with a large number of
Scottish (and American and other) companies and societies registering
organisational tartans. These are generally protected by copyright
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright> and sometimes trademark
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark> law. These tartans vary in
purpose from general corporate livery, to special event tartans, to
tartans for fictional characters.

Two examples of the latter are Sanrio <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Sanrio>'s 2004 creation of a predominantly pink tartan for Hello Kitty
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_Kitty>;^[92] <#cite_note-

Mérida, of the animated Highland fantasy/adventure film /Brave <https://

        Fashion[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
        title=Tartan&action=edit&section=40>]

rearing-horseman logos superimposed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
File:Burberry_handbag.jpg>Handbag in Burberry <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Burberry> check

An early example of a tartan created by and for the fashion industry,
and surely the most famous, is "Burberry check". It was introduced in
the 1920s for the lining of trench coats made by Burberry <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry> of London, but has been used for all
manner of clothing and accessories since 1967^[931] <#cite_note-1039>
(with another major marketing push in 2001) and is emblematic of the
company and its upscale product line.^[932] <#cite_note-1040> (For
additional information, including a legal dispute, see § Legal
protection <#Legal_protection>, below.)

A fast-growing category in the /SRT/ is that of "fashion" tartans,
created by companies and individual designers simply for aesthetic
reasons, without any association with a particular clan, family, region,
etc. Like organisational tartans, most of these have a copyright claim
attached to them.

A prominent example: In 2017, Scottish fashion designer Charles Jeffrey
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Jeffrey_(fashion_designer)>
designed a signature tartan for his Loverboy label, registering it in
the /SRT/.^[126] <#cite_note-SRT_Loverboy-143>


    Regulation[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=41>]

Manufacture and use of tartan (at least in the Scottish context) is
regulated, formally and informally, in three ways: /registration/
(recording of a tartan and its association, if any, with a particular
family, organisation, person, event, etc.); /legal protection/ of a
tartan as intellectual property (trademark, copyright); and /etiquette/
(socio-cultural norms regarding the use of tartan and Highland dress).


      Registration[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=42>]

File:Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Scottish_Register_of_Tartans.svg>Coat of arms
of the Scottish Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans>

The naming and registration of "official" clan tartans began in 1815,
when the Highland Society of London <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Highland_Society_of_London> solicited clan tartans from clan chiefs.

Following recognition by a clan chief of a tartan as a clan tartan, the
chief was formerly able to petition the Lord Lyon King of Arms <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms>, the Scottish heraldic
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry> authority, to register it as a
formal clan tartan.^[de] <#cite_note-1041> Once approved by the Lord
Lyon, after recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Tartan, the clan
tartan was then recorded in the Lyon Court Books.^[294] <#cite_note-
Campbell_of_Airds-336> However, leading up to the launch of the Scottish
Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> in 2009 (see below for details), the
office of the Lord Lyon stopped providing this tartan-recording process
(though its statutory authority was not changed by the Tartans Bill).

Modern-day tartans can be created and registered by anyone, with the
Scottish Register of Tartans. Modern registered tartans include ones for
Scottish and other districts, cities, and towns; for Irish counties
(devised since the 1990s)^[106] <#cite_note-Newsome_2006-123> and
families (for example, the surname Fitzpatrick <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_(surname)> has two registered
tartans^[933] <#cite_note-1042> ); for organisations and companies; and
even for specific events or individuals. Tartans are also being created
in record numbers among the Scottish diaspora <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Scottish_diaspora> in the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, etc., especially for places, military divisions, pipe bands,
and individuals and their immediate families.

Until the late 20th century, instead of a central official tartan
registry, independent organisations located in Scotland, Canada, and the
United States documented and recorded tartans.^[934] <#cite_note-1043>
In 1963, an organisation called the Scottish Tartans Society <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Society> (now defunct, and
originally named Scottish Tartans Information Centre)^[591] <#cite_note-
Scarlett1990_ix-670> was created to record and preserve every known
tartan design.^[935] <#cite_note-1044> The society's /Register of All
Publicly Known Tartans/ (/RAPKT/) contained about 2,700 different
designs of tartan.^[936] <#cite_note-Newsome_2004-1045> Registration of
new designs was not free of charge. The society, however, ran into
financial troubles in 2000, and folded.^[937] <#cite_note-1046> ^[388]
<#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>

Former members of that society formed two new Scotland-based entities –
the Scottish Tartans Authority <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Authority> (STA, 1996 – before STS closed) and the
Scottish Tartans World Register <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Tartans_Society#Scottish_Tartans_World_Register> (STWR, 2000 –
the trade name <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name> of a private
company, Tartan Registration Ltd).^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>
Both of these organisations initially based their databases on the /
RAPKT/. STA's database, the /International Tartan Index/ (/ITI/)
consisted of about 3,500 different tartans (with over 7,000, counting
variants) as of 2004.^[936] <#cite_note-Newsome_2004-1045> The online /
ITI/ was later rebranded /The Tartan Ferret/. STWR's self-titled /
Scottish Tartans World Register/ database was made up of about 3,000
different designs as of 2004.^[936] <#cite_note-Newsome_2004-1045> Both
organisations were registered as Scottish charities <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization#Scotland> and recorded new
tartans (free in the case of STA and for a fee in the case of STWR) on
request.^[938] <#cite_note-1047> ^[939] <#cite_note-1048>

In the interim, a jointly Scotland- and US-based organisation,
International Association of Tartan Studies and Tartan Educational &
Cultural Association (IATS/TECA) emerged in 1984^[388] <#cite_note-
Newsome_2005-435> and published its own /TartanArt/ database in the
early 1990s as Microsoft Windows software which was much used in the
North American kilt-making trade. IATS/TECA was absorbed by STA by
2005.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435>

The Scottish Register of Tartans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scottish_Register_of_Tartans> (SRT) is Scotland's official tartan
register, and was established in 2009.^[940] <#cite_note-SRT_home-1049>
SRT is maintained and administered by the National Archives of Scotland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_of_Scotland> (NAS), a
statutory body based in Edinburgh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Edinburgh>.^[941] <#cite_note-1050> The aim of the register is to
provide a definitive and accessible resource to promote and preserve
tartans. It is also intended to be the definitive source for the
registration of new tartans (if they pass criteria for inclusion and a
registration fee is paid). The database itself – also named simply /
Scottish Register of Tartans/, and sometimes called /TartanRegister/
from its domain name – is made up of the pre-existing registers of STA
and STWR as they were at the time of SRT's launch (preserving the STA's
and STWR's registration numbers, dates, and other details in the SRT
data), plus new registrations from 5 February 2009 onward. On the
register's website, users can register new tartans, search for existing
tartans and request their thread counts, and receive notifications of
newly registered tartans.^[940] <#cite_note-SRT_home-1049> ^[942]
<#cite_note-1051>

STWR became defunct some time after 2008. STA later closed the /ITI/
Tartan Ferret/ to new registrations, and in late 2022 removed the search
feature from the STA website (pending a site redesign), deferring to the
Scottish Register of Tartans, which now appears to be the only operating
tartan registry. STA continues offline work on the /ITI/ database,
correcting errors, importing new /SRT/ additions, and recording
historical patterns newly discovered in museum holdings, etc.


      Legal protection[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=43>]

Some modern tartans are protected by trademark <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark> law, and the trademark proprietor can,
in certain circumstances, prevent others from selling that tartan.^[128]
<#cite_note-MacDonald1995_48-145> An example is the "Burberry <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry> check" of the English fashion house, an
instantly recognisable tartan that is very well known around the
world.^[943] <#cite_note-1052> ^[df] <#cite_note-1056>

Unlike trademark registration <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Trademark_registration> and copyright registration <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_registration>, the Scottish Register of
Tartans (SRT) and its authorising Tartans Bill do not create any new or
enhanced intellectual property <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Intellectual_property> rights through the act of registration (nor
provide any enforcement mechanism other than removal of infringing
entries from the registry).^[947] <#cite_note-1057>

SRT, however, permits registrants optionally to assert and record
copyright and/or trademark claims over their new tartans, for designs
that are eligible for such protection under other established law^[948]
<#cite_note-1058> (such as the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright,_Designs_and_Patents_Act_1988>;
and the Scotland Act 1998 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Scotland_Act_1998>, which took over copyright and trademark registration
and enforcement in Scotland)^[949] <#cite_note-1059> and lists such
tartans as restricted. An SRT registration "provides evidence of the
existence and date of [the] design",^[950] <#cite_note-
SRT_copyright-1060> which helps establish the copyright date under the
Berne Copyright Convention <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Berne_Copyright_Convention>. Such legal protections apply only to
comparatively recently created tartans; old clan, regimental, and
district tartans are outside the protection periods of such intellectual
property laws.^[44] <#cite_note-Blakely_13-53>

SRT also permits the listing of intended /use and manufacture/
restriction preferences, but has no enforcement capability,^[951]
<#cite_note-1061> and also includes a statement that "No other rights
can be conferred."^[950] <#cite_note-SRT_copyright-1060> British tartan
weavers, such as Lochcarron and D. C. Dalgliesh, generally will not
produce material in an SRT "restricted" tartan without written evidence
of permission from the copyright/trademark claimant. In additional
furtherance of intellectual property concerns, the SRT also refuses to
register a new tartan that is confusingly similar to any existing one
(as determined by an SRT review process).^[952] <#cite_note-1062>

The application of copyright law to tartans is not well tested. The
leading British legal case on textile copyright, concerned with designs
printed on fabric, is /Designer Guild Ltd v Russell Williams (Textiles)
Ltd <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Designer_Guild_Ltd_v_Russell_Williams_(Textiles)_Ltd>/ (2000), finding
for fairly broad copyright protection in textile works that involve
creative originality.^[953] <#cite_note-1063> In 2008, two tartan
pattern copyright holders, Rosemary Nicolson Samios and weaver
Lochcarron of Scotland, took legal action for infringement of an Isle of
Skye <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Skye> district sett
(designed 1993) and the Princess Diana <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Princess_Diana> Memorial sett (designed 1997), respectively, against the
Gold Brothers firm of Surinder, Galab, Malap, and Dildar Singh, who
operate dozens of stores in Scotland and online that sell primarily

tartan was considerably profitable for Samios, after the pattern was
popularised by Queen Elizabeth II <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

by Alistair Buchan of Lochcanrron and of the Scottish Tartans Authority
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Authority> as a charity
fundraiser. A British court on 2 July 2008 issued an interim interdict
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdicts_in_Scots_law> (preliminary
injunction) against Gold Brothers' sale of Isle of Skye goods, after a
police search found hundreds of metres of the pattern in Chinese-made
cloth in the company's warehouse.^[865] <#cite_note-Newsome_2008-959>

<#cite_note-1066> Both cases may have been settled out-of-court
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)> because
published news regarding them ceases in 2008. A more recent case, /
Abraham Moon & Sons Ltd v. Thornber & Others/ (2012), actually involved
tartan. It held that the textual /ticket stamp/ (a detailed set of
weaving instructions, i.e. a thread count with additional information on
precise colours, etc.) used to produce a tartan designed in-house by the
claimant had been infringed, was protected as a literary work, and /
also/ constituted a "recording" of the graphical work of the tartan and
thus was independently protected as a work of artistic
craftsmanship.^[44] <#cite_note-Blakely_13-53> ^[957] <#cite_note-1067>
As of 2020,^[update] <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
title=Tartan&action=edit> the decision was being appealed, as it
conflicted with previous caselaw, e.g. /Hensher v Restawile/ (1976),
holding such instructions to be uncopyrightable.^[958] <#cite_note-1068>

While tartan arguably could be classified as a form of intangible
cultural heritage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Intangible_cultural_heritage>,^[959] <#cite_note-1069> and its value to
identifying Scottish products both in Scotland and internationally has
been recognised and exploited for a long time,^[929] <#cite_note-
PatersonMB_168-1037> tartan is not protected by either geographical
indication (protected designation of origin) <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/
Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union> law, nor /sui generis <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis#Intellectual_property_law>/ legislation specific to that kind of product.^[960] <#cite_note-1070> Harris tweed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_tweed>, another textile associated more narrowly with Scotland, does have such protection. In 1998, Keith Lumsden, research officer of the Scottish Tartans Society <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Society>, proposed that the word /tartan/ be prohibited for use to market a textile, unless the design was accepted in an official governmental tartan registry (which did not then exist).^[929] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_168-1037> When the Scottish Parliament finally authorised the Scottish Register of Tartans in 2008, it did not include anything like this sort of trade protection. According to Michael B. Paterson (2001): "No mechanism exists to protect [traditional Scottish] tartan from 'misuse' by interests having nothing to do with Scotland or Scotland's interests", though the tartan registries "play an important, if weak, role in asserting Scotland's cultural rights <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_rights> in relation to tartan."^[961] <#cite_note-1071>


      Etiquette[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
      title=Tartan&action=edit&section=44>]

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ConneryKilt.jpg>Scottish actor Sean
Connery <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery> at a Tartan Day
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Day> celebration in Washington DC.
When knighted <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight> by Queen Elizabeth
II in 2000, he wore this green-and-black hunting-tartan kilt of his
mother's Clan Maclean <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Maclean>.

Since the Victorian era <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era>,
authorities on tartan have claimed that there is an etiquette <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette> to wearing tartan, specifically tartan
attributed to clans or families. In the same line of opinion, some
tartans attributed to the British royal family <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family> have been claimed to be "off
limits" to non-royalty.^[962] <#cite_note-1072> ^[963] <#cite_note-1073>
Even so, there are no laws or universally accepted rules on who can or
cannot wear a particular tartan. The concept of the entitlement to
certain tartans has led to the term /universal tartan/, or /free
tartan/, which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone. Traditional
examples of such are the Black Watch, Caledonia, hunting Stewart, and
Jacobite tartans, shepherds' check <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Shepherds%27_check>, and district tartans.^[964] <#cite_note-1074>
^[788] <#cite_note-PatersonMB_172-880> ^[965] <#cite_note-1075> The
published marketing of tartans for simple fashion purposes without any
association to a place or body dates back to at least 1745,^[485]
<#cite_note-StewartDW+Trevor-Roper_on_1745_ad-552> and much of Wilsons'
output through the 19th century consisted of "fancy" patterns for the
general public.^[966] <#cite_note-1076> Some recently created designs
intended for everyone (though some are exclusive to particular weavers
or Highland dress outfitters) have names including Braveheart, Clansman,
European Union, Highlander, Independence, Pride of Scotland, Rainbow,
Scotland 2000, Scotland the Brave, Scottish National, Scottish
Parliament, Spirit of Scotland, Stone of Destiny, and Twenty First
Century.^[967] <#cite_note-1077>

Books on Scottish clans list such rules and guidelines.^[128]
<#cite_note-MacDonald1995_48-145> One such opinion is that people not
bearing a clan surname, or surname claimed as a sept of a clan, should
not wear the tartan of their mother's clan.^[968] <#cite_note-1078> This
opinion is reinforced by the fact that in the Scottish clan system, the
Lord Lyon states that membership to a clan technically passes through
the surname. This means that children who bear their father's surname
belong to the father's clan (if any), and that children who bear their
mother's surname (her maiden name <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Maiden_and_married_names>) belong to their mother's clan (if any).^[969]
<#cite_note-1079> Also, the Lord Lyon states that a clan tartan should
only be worn by those who profess allegiance to that clan's chief.^[970]
<#cite_note-1080>

Some clan societies even claim that certain tartans are the personal
property of a chief or chieftain, and in some cases they allow or deny
their clansfolk "permission" to wear that tartan.^[dg] <#cite_note-1082>
According to the Scottish Tartans Authority <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Scottish_Tartans_Authority> – which is an establishment of the
Scottish tartan industry – the Balmoral tartan should not be worn by
anyone who is not part of the British royal family. Even so, some
weavers outside of the United Kingdom ignore the "longstanding
convention" of the British royal family's "right" to this tartan. The
society also claims that non-royals who wear this tartan are treated
with "great disdain" by the Scottish tartan industry.^[972]
<#cite_note-1083> ^[dh] <#cite_note-1086>

Generally, a more liberal attitude had been taken by those in the
business of selling tartan, holding that anyone may wear any tartan they
like. Under the liberal view, claimed "rules" are mere conventions (some
of which are recent creations), with different levels of importance
depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular
occasion.

The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Standing_Council_of_Scottish_Chiefs> has also taken a fairly flexible
position (organisationally; some specific individual chiefs may have a
narrower or looser take, and not all chiefs are members). Aside from
opposing the creation of a new tartan using a clan's name without the
chief's permission, their website states:^[975] <#cite_note-1087>

    There are no strict rules on who has the right to wear a particular
    tartan. People normally wear only the tartan (if any) of their
    surname, or a "district tartan" connected with where they live or
    where their family come from. Wearing a particular clan tartan
    indicates that the wearer bears an allegiance to the chief of that clan.

Some Highland dress historians have taken a dim view of regulatory
intents and proclamations with regard to tartans; Scottish National
Portrait Gallery curator A. E. Haswell Miller wrote that "to claim
special entitlement to a tartan in the same manner as heraldic arms is
certainly absurd", because evidence suggests that the idea was just
invented by writers of the late 18th to mid-19th centuries.^[976]
<#cite_note-1088> Sir Thomas Dick Lauder <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Thomas_Dick_Lauder> expressed similar views as far back as 1829, right
in the middle of the "clan tartanry" rush, dismissing both the then-new
adoption of "official" clan tartans and attempts by clans to claim
regimental ones.^[550] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_116-625>


    In other cultures[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=45>]

While tartan has been most closely associated with Scotland, and dating
back to the Roman period was perhaps associated with Northwestern Europe
in general, it is likely that the idea of using patterns of rectangles
and lines has independently occurred many times, in any cultures with
weaving.^[977] <#cite_note-CampbellJF_366-1089> Basic tartan "is almost
as primitive a weave as it is possible to make ... probably the earliest
form of patterened fabric anywhere."^[3] <#cite_note-BdLC_57-3>
Surviving pre-modern historical examples seem sparse, however.

Modern tartan-style cloth in a wide variety of materials and patterns
from simple to complex is available and used today around the world,
often simply as a style of cloth and without any association with Scotland.

Among the Maasai people <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people> of
Kenya and Tanzania, the /shúkà/ is a cotton <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cotton> blanket-like garment (what Scots would call a plaid) worn
as a wrap, and very commonly in a tartan pattern, though sometimes
linearly striped or of one colour.^[978] <#cite_note-Oyange-
Ngando_5-1090> /Shúkà/ are predominantly red, though sometimes seen in
blue and other colours.

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maasai_people> men in /shúkà/; Narok County

/Shúkà/ were originally of painted (typically red) leather, but Maasai
have had access to plain-weave <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain-
weave> cotton fabric for some time, imported to the region by Americans
since the 1860s.^[978] <#cite_note-Oyange-Ngando_5-1090> Joseph Thomas
Last <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Thomas_Last>, a British
missionary <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary>, in 1883 described
the Maasai as particularly fond of red and white cloth, to be worn by
higher-status men (though he did not mention tartan in
particular);^[979] <#cite_note-Last-1091> a 1903 report also had them
typically wearing red blanket-like garments, after a time of favouring
blue.^[978] <#cite_note-Oyange-Ngando_5-1090> The Maasai were loosely
allied with the British, 1895–1904,^[980] <#cite_note-1092> and the
latter made heavy use of Scottish regiments <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Scottish_regiment> in African conflicts, bringing tartan with them.
However, "Guinea <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea> cloth" (mostly
produced in India), sometimes red and blue checked, was a common
commodity in 18th-century western Africa, pre-dating British West Africa
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Africa>; whether it relates
at all to /shúkà/ is unknown.^[981] <#cite_note-Huang-1093> /Shúkà/
patterns usually lack the thin black lines common in Scottish tartans.

A nomadic cattle-pastoralist <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism>
culture, without their own weaving tradition, the Maasai have been
described as unusually culturally conservative and resistant to
modernisation.^[982] <#cite_note-1094> Nevertheless, they have always
engaged in trade to get goods they do not make themsevles,^[979]
<#cite_note-Last-1091> and have made local traditional use of modern
materials.^[983] <#cite_note-1095> The Maasai approach has been to
resist yet assimilate colonial <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Colonisation_of_Africa> and post-colonial influences.^[984] <#cite_note-
Mastamet-Mason_et_al.-1096>

Although there is evidence of tartan usage among the Maasai to at least
the period 1906–1918, when Walther Dobbertin <https://en.wikipedia.org/
w/index.php?title=Walther_Dobbertin&action=edit&redlink=1> photographed
a tartan /shúkà/ in what was then German East Africa <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa>, the current bright tartan and
striped style of /shúkà/ appears to have been adopted primarily in the
1960s^[981] <#cite_note-Huang-1093> ^[985] <#cite_note-1097> (partly in
response to national-level clothing modernisation pressure), supplanting
leather but keeping the same form-factor.^[984] <#cite_note-Mastamet-
Mason_et_al.-1096> The shift in outward form without affecting function
led one writer to quip that Maasai dress "has undergone dramatic changes
while not changing at all".^[986] <#cite_note-1098> Tartan-patterned
cloth is not typically used for other Maasai garments besides /shúkà/.

The /shúkà/ has become so emblematic of the Maasai that there is some
discussion (driven by the Maasai themselves) at the national and
regional level about protecting it as a form of cultural property
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_property>.^[987]
<#cite_note-1099> While it has been claimed that /shúkà/ patterns, at
least at one time, conveyed particular meanings,^[di] <#cite_note-1100>
and there historically have long been weaving operations in various
African areas,^[988] <#cite_note-1101> most /shúkà/ today that are not
mass-manufactured in Dar es Salaam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Dar_es_Salaam> actually come from China, not Africa.^[981] <#cite_note-

Madras is a patterened, light-weight, breatheable, cotton cloth named
for the Madras (now Chennai <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai>)
area of India.^[1002] <#cite_note-1117> Traditional madras is hand-woven
from lumpy, carded <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carding>-cotton
thread, and coloured with natural dyes which may bleed together upon
washing to create a more muted pattern than typical tartan, as well as a
rougher texture.^[1003] <#cite_note-Checkered_Past-1118> Madras also has
a "softer" look because it typically lacks the black lines found in most
Scottish tartans. Madras cloth dates to at least the 16th century,
produced in a variety of patterns, including religious designs and
floral prints.^[1003] <#cite_note-Checkered_Past-1118> It is unclear if
tartan patterns were among the original designs, though they became very
popular later. Weaving, primarily for export, in Madras/Chennai became a
large-scale commercial enterprise after the British East India Company
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company> came to control the
area in the mid-17th century.^[1004] <#cite_note-1119> Major production
of this style of cloth also took place in Cambay State <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambay_State> (present-day Gujarat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat>).^[1005] <#cite_note-Coo-1120>

Madras, ideal for warm-weather wear, became popular in the Philippines
(where it is known as /cambaya/)^[1005] <#cite_note-Coo-1120> and the
Caribbean;^[1003] <#cite_note-Checkered_Past-1118> mainly in undyed
form, it was also exported to Europe.^[1003] <#cite_note-
Checkered_Past-1118> Tartan madras reached America by 1718, and appeared
in the 1897 Sears <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears>
catalogue.^[1003] <#cite_note-Checkered_Past-1118> It was popular in the
United States in the 1930s and again in the 1960s, often associated with
preppy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preppy> style.^[1003] <#cite_note-
Checkered_Past-1118> Substantial export of the cloth to South Africa
began in 1958.^[1003] <#cite_note-Checkered_Past-1118>

Modern madras cloth is commonly in tartan patterns, but also simply
striped (seersucker <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seersucker>). Unlike
Scottish-style tartan, madras is not woven in 2/2 twill <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twill> pattern, but is a muslin <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin> of plain weave <https://en.wikipedia.org/

lines (see detail image <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Madras-

In Japan, tartan patterns called /kōshi/ 格子 (also /koushi/ or /
goushi/, literally 'lattice') or /kōshijima/ 格子縞 date back to at
least the 18th century,^[398] <#cite_note-HaswellMiller1956-446>
possibly the 17th^[1006] <#cite_note-1121> in the Edo period <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period> (1603–1867), and were popular for /
kabuki <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki>/ theatrical costuming,
which inspired general public use by both sexes, for the /kosode
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosode>/ (precursor of the /kimono
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono>/), the /obi <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_(sash)>/, and other garments.^[1007]
<#cite_note-Scholten-1122> The name is a reference to the details of /
shoji <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoji>/ room dividers, the grid
pattern said to stand for strength, with larger stripes representing
more power.^[1007] <#cite_note-Scholten-1122> /Kōshi/ range from simple
checked patterns to complex multi-colour weaves. Ikat <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat> thread-dyeing techniques were sometimes
employed before the weaving, such that a colour in the pattern was
mottled,^[1007] <#cite_note-Scholten-1122> and parts of the design may
sometimes have been embroidered <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Embroidery>, supplementary-woven <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Supplementary_weaving>, or dyed-over for additional highlight or
contrast.^[1007] <#cite_note-Scholten-1122> Some styles have particular
names, such as /misuji-kōshi/ ('three-striped lattice')^[1007]
<#cite_note-Scholten-1122> and /futasuji-kōshi/ ('forked
lattice').^[1008] <#cite_note-1123> A pattern with larger squares is
more generally called /ogoshi/ or with smaller squares /kogoshi/.^[1009]
<#cite_note-1124>

It is unclear whether there was a Scottish tartan influence on the
development of /kōshi/. The Edo period pre-dates the Perry Expedition
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Expedition> of 1853–1854 and its
opening of Japan to general Western <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Western_world> trade, but mostly post-dates early European contact from
1543 to the closure of Japan to outsiders in 1639 under the /sakoku
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakoku>/ isolationist policy.

Nothing suggests that particular patterns have been associated with
specific families or Japanese clans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Japanese_clans>.

Today, /kōshijima/ is the general Japanese word for 'tartan/plaid,
checked pattern'.^[1010] <#cite_note-1125> Tartan is popular in present-
day Japan, both for high fashion and for streetwear,^[308] <#cite_note-
NatGeo-352> as well as school uniforms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
School_uniforms_in_Japan>.^[674] <#cite_note-Tuckett_20-763> Since the
1960s, the Japanese department store chain Isetan <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isetan> has used an emblematic tartan as a
marketing tool (e.g. on all its shopping bags); the pattern is based on
some MacMillan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacMillan>
tartans.^[1011] <#cite_note-1126> Japan hosted a major museum exhibit
about tartan in 2018.^[1012] <#cite_note-1127>


      Eastern Europe to Western Asia[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/
      index.php?title=Tartan&action=edit&section=52>]

Tartan-style patterns are common throughout Southeastern Europe.

In northern Eurasia, tartan fabrics are also common to Finnic peoples
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnic_peoples> of Russia and nearby
Latvia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia>, Estonia <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia>, and Sápmi <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/S%C3%A1pmi> (Lappland, a cultural region that crosses northern
Russia, Finland, Sweden, and Norway); John Francis Campbell <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Francis_Campbell> (1862) described native
weaving of the Sámi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi> (Lapps) of
his era as being hand-loom tartan.^[977] <#cite_note-CampbellJF_366-1089>

Considerably to the southeast, the Tatars <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Tatars>^[dl] <#cite_note-1128> and Chuvash <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvash_people>, Turkic <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Turkic_peoples> peoples of Tatarstan <https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Tatarstan> and Chuvashia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuvashia>,
respectively, in the Russian Federation, have worn tartan, striped, and
other patterns since at least the 19th century.

Robert Jamieson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Robert_Jamieson_(antiquary)>, writing in 1818 as editor of Edmund Burt
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burt>'s 1727–37 /Letters of a
Gentleman in the North of Scotland/, said that in his era, married women
of the north-western provinces of Russia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Russia> wore tartan plaids "of massy silk, richly varied, with broad
cross-bars of gold and silver tissue".^[95] <#cite_note-

wiki/Alexander_Pushkin> wearing a tartan cape; by Orest Kiprensky
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orest_Kiprensky>, 1827

The Russian poet Alexander Pushkin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Alexander_Pushkin> (1799–1837), who was influenced by the romantic-
Highlands writings of Walter Scott <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Walter_Scott>,^[1013] <#cite_note-1129> ^[1014] <#cite_note-1130> posed
for one of the most famous paintings in Russia, the 1827 portrait
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kiprensky_Pushkin.jpg> by Orest
Kiprensky <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orest_Kiprensky>. Pushkin wears
what looks at first like a Scottish-style tartan shoulder plaid
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_plaid>, but is more probably a
sleeveless "Almaviva" cape/cloak, a style in fashion at the time and
known to have been worn by Pushkin.^[752] <#cite_note-Kirsanova-844>

Tartan was commented on in the /Moscow Telegraph/ in 1826 as being in
broad fashion in the city for all sorts of garments (often as a
decorative accent).^[752] <#cite_note-Kirsanova-844> Scottish-style
plaids apparently did come into some fashion in Russia as women's wear
for a space during the mid-to-late 19th century, a style picked up from
stage productions; some 19th century Russian paintings illustrate
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T.P.Musina-Pushkina.jpg> use of
plaids as shawls <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawl>.^[752]
<#cite_note-Kirsanova-844> Tartan (and plain-striped) shawls were also
common among the Volga Germans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Volga_Germans> and Bessarabia Germans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bessarabia_Germans> in Russia; a mixture of hand-woven (originally as
bedclothes and other household goods) and mass-produced in Russia, the
shawls became emblematic of the German-from-Russia diaspora <https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora> in North and South America from the
nineteenth century to the mid-20th.^[1015] <#cite_note-1131> ^[1016]
<#cite_note-1132>

Around the end of the 19th century, the Russian equivalent of Regency
and Victorian British tartanware objects, such as decorative Fedoskino
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedoskino_miniature> boxes with tartan
accents in a style called /Shotlandka/ Шотландка (literally
'Scotlandish'), were produced by companies like the Lukutin Manufactory
on the outskirts of Moscow <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Moscow>.^[1017] <#cite_note-1133>

Today, /shotlandka/ or /shotlandki/ шотландки are simply Russian words
for 'tartan/plaid' generally.^[1018] <#cite_note-1134>

    Notes[edit <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?
    title=Tartan&action=edit&section=58>]

 1. *^ <#cite_ref-16>* The use of /plaid/ to mean 'tartan' has not
    been /exclusively/ North American; in 1808, the London publication /
    La Belle Assemblée <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    La_Belle_Assembl%C3%A9e>/ referred to "plaid scarfs".^[14]
    <#cite_note-14> Also, it has sometimes been claimed that /plaid/
    refers to all such patterns generally, and /tartan/ only to patterns
    of Scottish clans,^[15] <#cite_note-Black_3-15> but there is no
    support for this idea in works of tartan scholarship.
 2. *^ <#cite_ref-20>* MacBain (1911) <#MA>, p. 277. Cognate <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate> words in other languages are the
    Luwian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luwian_language> /pldtmn/ and
    later Latin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin> /paludamentum/ for
    'cloak'. The /paludamentum/ was a cloak put on by Roman officers in
    time of war.^[17] <#cite_note-18> ^[18] <#cite_note-19>
 3. *^ <#cite_ref-22>* Solid-colour, non-tartan kilts were often thought
    to be an Irish invention of the late 19th century, but an example of
    a belted plaid or "great kilt" from Scotland was found in a 1635
    portrait of Sir Duncan Campbell of Loch Awe <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Awe>,^[19] <#cite_note-
    Newsome_Wilkinson-21> among other Scottish examples.
 4. *^ <#cite_ref-30>* The two Scarlett sources provide two exact
    formulas which seem at first to be contradictory, but one is for
    number of blends and the other for number of colours total.
 5. *^ <#cite_ref-38>* The term /mirroring/ can be ambiguous, because
    the longer phrase /mirror pattern/ may refer to "one in which ...
    two alternating ground motifs are the same size and arrangement but
    in different colours."^[33] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2022-37>
 6. *^ <#cite_ref-40>* The term /repeating/^[28] <#cite_note-
    SRT_threadcount-32> has also been used, as distinct from /
    mirroring/, but is so ambiguous that sometimes the same patterns are
    referred to as /non-repeating/.^[34] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald_wedding-39> Neither term will be used further in this
    article.
 7. *^ <#cite_ref-42>* A well-known example is the main Buchanan
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Buchanan> tartan.^[35]

 8. ^ Jump up to: ^/*a*/ <#cite_ref-ExMacMillan_45-0> ^/*b*/ <#cite_ref-
    ExMacMillan_45-1> An example is the most popular MacMillan <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacMillan> tartan, in which the warp and
    weft are different, though similar; the largest blocks of colour are
    green rectangles instead of squares.^[37] <#cite_note-SRT_MacMillan-44>
 9. *^ <#cite_ref-51>* Early collectors of tartan, like Logan in 1831,
    recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in eighths of
    an inch.^[38] <#cite_note-STA_threadcount-46> ^[39] <#cite_note-47>
    A persistent legend that tartans were originally recorded on little
    "pattern sticks" has been dispelled as a "telephone game <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_game>"-style progressive, willful
    misunderstanding of an early description of the warp as wrapped on a
    warp beam/roller for the loom. It was poorly described by Martin
    Martin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Martin> in 1703 as "an
    exact Pattern of the Plad on a piece of Wood", which Logan (1831)
    misunderstood as a small stick used as a perpetual "record" of the
    tartan pattern on it, after which the "Sobieski Stuarts <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobieski_Stuarts>" in 1842 blatantly falsified
    a supposed 16th-century description of "pattern sticks", and
    Archibald Campbell (1890) repeated the story again as factual. No
    such artefact has ever been found by modern researchers, and the
    idea has been described as impractical because the threads would not
    stay put indefinitely, and it would make much more sense to simply
    write or draw the pattern on paper, or keep a strip of the woven
    material.^[40] <#cite_note-48> ^[41] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald2015-49> Mackay (1924) claimed he had seen some
    examples and appeared to describe warp beams, but then claimed they
    were used as a long-term record of "clan tartans" of the area.^[42]
    <#cite_note-50> Eslea MacDonald (2015) points out that Mackay had a
    tendency toward "manipulating the evidence" when advancing his ideas
    about very old clan tartans, and that he made up a fake-Gaelic name
    for the alleged pattern sticks.^[41] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2015-49>
10. *^ <#cite_ref-55>* For example, Stewart, D. C. (1974) <#SDC>,
    Scarlett (1990) <#SJD>, and Scottish Register of Tartans (2009–) all
    use full-count-at-pivots "bare" thread counts, without slash or bold
    notation, while Eslea MacDonald (2012) <#EMP> uses them to represent
    half-count-at-pivots, but states this explicitly.
11. *^ <#cite_ref-61>* /Ground/ in this sense dates to at least 1895.
    Telfer Dunbar (1979) <#TDJ>, pp. 112–113, quoting 1895 letter:
    "... dress Stuart tartan on a white instead of on a red ground ....
    the 'Stuart hunting-tartan' on a green ground". However, /ground/
    has a different meaning at the thread-dyeing stage, where it refers
    to a first layer of colour which is then over-dyed with another,
    either to deepen the hue or make a new ones, e.g. purple from blue
    over red.^[50] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_227-60>
12. *^ <#cite_ref-69>* Wilsons, the near-exclusive producer of Georgian
    through Victorian regimental tartan, produced different grades of
    cloth for officers, sergeants, and enlisted.^[57] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald_2012-01-68>
13. *^ <#cite_ref-91>* Scarlett (1990) provided a reconstruction of what
    17th- to early 18th-century arisaid tartans probably basically
    looked like <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    File:Earasaid_tartan_reconstruction_by_Scarlett,_centred,_zoomed_out.png>, based on the appearance of later wider-banded "bar blanket" tartans which evolved from the arisaid setts. His sample is modernised in being simplified, symmetrical, mirroring, and not having a decorative selvedge.^[78] <#cite_note-90>
14. *^ <#cite_ref-103>* The French term /écru/ has also been
    applied,^[88] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_10-101> but is
    ambiguous, as it technically refers to the colour of undyed linen
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen> not wool, and has been taken
    to indicate a richer, sandy range of hues in English usage than in
    French.^[89] <#cite_note-102>
15. *^ <#cite_ref-104>* The Lord Lyon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Lord_Lyon_King_of_Arms>'s colour-coding system actually had three
    reds: "gules/scarlet", "red" (a dull red), and "crimson".^[46]
    <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_63-56> But it is not entirely clear what
    the difference between them is.

18. *^ <#cite_ref-148>* A romantic legend about such a thing goes back
    quite a way, however. According to Innes of Learney (1971): "The
    late J. G. Mackay, like Lord Archibald Campbell, claimed that clan
    tartans were not only deliberately arranged, but formed an elaborate
    system of identification by dress, as technical as armorial bearings
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms> .... [T]artans were
    never intended to, and did not, have the precise distinctions and
    ready recognisability of armorial bearings. Mr Mackay gives much
    interesting information ...; he does not, however, succeed in
    adducing evidence that there was a scientific system of arrangement,
    and circumstances are against the existence of a /science/."^[129]
    <#cite_note-146> In summary, Mackay believed that lines of various
    colours formed a heraldic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry>
    system of cadency (differencing) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Cadency> between related family branches.^[130] <#cite_note-147> The
    argument depends on the Victorian-era clan tartans having been used
    in the 17th–18th centuries, but all modern tartan scholarship shows
    this idea to be broadly false.

    tartarin/ in various spellings, but they do not clearly refer to
    tartan, either the cloth or the pattern, but rather seem to refer to
    valued cloth in general.^[5] <#cite_note-DOST-5>
24. *^ <#cite_ref-196>* There is a legend that during some period there
    was a "caste" system by which chiefs were entited to up to seven
    colours in a tartan, fewer colours were allowed for clansmen
    according to position in the social hierarchy, and just single-
    coloured cloth for servants. Barnes & Allen (1956)^[94] <#cite_note-
    Barnes_&_Allen_266-110> attributed the idea to Frank Adam (1908). He
    did indeed write that "it is said" there was such a system, but
    cited no evidence.^[134] <#cite_note-Adam_385-152> The fancy is from
    Logan (1831), who cites nothing but an ancient "Achy Edgathach
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eochaid_%C3%89tgudach>" of
    Ireland.^[168] <#cite_note-191> That was a legendary ancient Irish
    king in the /Lebor Gabála Érenn <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Lebor_Gab%C3%A1la_%C3%89renn>/, said to have passed a sumptuary law
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law> limiting clothing
    colours by social status, during his very short reign of only four
    years (some time between 1537 and 1155 BC).^[169] <#cite_note-192>
    It is old Irish folklore and nothing to do with history of Scottish
    tartan. Scarlett (1990): "it is difficult to allow such a tale any
    credibility".^[136] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_10-154> No modern
    Highland-dress scholars repeat it seriously (the last one to do so
    seems to have been Mackay (1924) who said it applied to "Druidical
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid> times"),^[170]
    <#cite_note-193> and the idea is contradicted by existence of old
    regional tartans of complexity, and by chiefs adopting tartans of
    marked simplicity. Practically, the extra dye and weaving-labour
    expenses of complicated tartans meant that they cost more and so
    were more often worn by monied persons,^[136] <#cite_note-
    Scarlett1990_10-154> as clearly reported by John Lesley <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lesley> (1578)^[171] <#cite_note-

    plaids of divers colours, sundrie ways divided, and among some the
    same custom is observed to this day, but for the most part they are
    brown, most near to the colour of the hadder [heather <https://

    Tielsch_210-1> The attempt to depict tartan is fairly crude, done as
    divided stripes, instead of a staggered pattern of blending
    rectangles, though it is possible it represents a weave with
    differing warp and weft <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Warp_and_weft>, which could produce more of a striped pattern. The
    exact details shown in the image are open to other question, because
    the artist illustrated an imaginative sword that is a combination of
    a Scottish claymore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymore> hilt
    with the blade and quillions of a German Landsknecht <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsknecht> sword of a type more familiar to
    the German (Silesian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia>)
    artist. Also, Telfer Dunbar (1979) called the colours yellow, blue,
    and red (not green, blue, and red), so the palette accuracy of the
    photo could be in doubt.^[184] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_53-209>

27. *^ <#cite_ref-215>* There is a recurrent legend running through
    Victorian works on tartan that the tartan cloth for each Highland
    man was usually made at home singly by his wife or mother,^[187]
    <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_CampbellA-213> but this proves to be an
    impractical idea,^[188] <#cite_note-214> for which there is no
    evidence, and considerable evidence against, including rich folk
    tradition of (mostly women's) group labour.
28. *^ <#cite_ref-221>* Innes of Learney (1938/1971) believed that
    Highlanders wore multiple tartans because some were personal
    (perhaps inherited), some geographical, and some clan-
    specific,^[193] <#cite_note-220> but presented no real evidence for
    this hypothesis. The idea can be traced to Lord Archibald Campbell
    (1890), who asserted (with no evidence at all) that a Highlander
    wearing multiple tartans at once could be explained by him donning
    the pattern of his commander, his own paternal clan, and maternal
    clan.^[187] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_CampbellA-213>
29. *^ <#cite_ref-240>* Even this, however, is ambiguous, and could mean
    that the Highlanders wore striped mantles, and worse their mantles
    in the same fashion that the Irish wore their own mantles, striped
    or not. And "striped" does not necessarily mean tartan. The Camden
    material is also contemporaneous with the Plantation of Ulster.
30. *^ <#cite_ref-248>* Taylor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    John_Taylor_(poet)>: " ... all and every man in generall in one
    habit .... For once in the yeere, ... many of the nobility and
    gentry of the kingdome (for their pleasure) doe come into these
    Highland countries to hunt, where they doe conforme themselves to
    the habite of the Highlandmen, who for the most part speake nothing
    but Irish [i.e. Gaelic] .... Their habite is shooes, with but one
    sole apiece; stockings (which they call short hose) made of a warm
    stuff of divers colours, which they call tartane; as for breeches,
    many of them, nor their forefathers, never wore any, but a jerkin of
    the same stuff that their hose is of; their garters being bands, or
    wreathes of hay or straw; with a plaed about their shoulders, which
    is a mantle of divers colours, much finer and lighter stuffe than
    their hose; with blue flat caps on their heads ...."^[218]
    <#cite_note-247>
31. *^ <#cite_ref-249>* Adam (1908/1970) makes the surprising claim that
    in Taylor's time, "any one who assumed the tartan of the clan was
    considered as being under the special protection of that clan" and
    implies that Taylor said this.^[179] <#cite_note-Adam_387-203> Adam
    invented it, as nothing like this is in Taylor's original material.
    Taylor simply said that vistors wearing Highland dress would be
    "conquered with kindnesse, and the sport will be plentifull".
32. *^ <#cite_ref-260>* E.g. in the revised 1707 edition of Rev. James
    Brome <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brome>'s /Travels over
    England, Scotland and Wales/, is material partly adapted from
    Buchanan (1582): "They go habited in Mantles striped, or streaked
    with divers colours about the Shoulders, which they call Plodden,
    with a Coat girt close to their Bodies, and commonly are naked up
    their Legs, but wear Sandals upon the Soles of their Feet, and their
    Women go clad much after the same Fashion."^[228] <#cite_note-259>
    This suggests a span of at least 1582–1707 of Highland fashion being
    rather consistent and unisex.
33. *^ <#cite_ref-272>* The same artist earlier painted a three-in-one
    portrait of actor-playwright John Lacy <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/File:John_Lacy_by_John_Michael_Wright.jpg>, in 1675, which
    featured trews and belted plaid,^[239] <#cite_note-271> but the
    tartan there is very casually represented as simple red and blue
    lines on white.
34. *^ <#cite_ref-279>* Martin Martin <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Martin_Martin> (1703) wrote: "each Isle differs from the other in
    their fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and
    Colours. This Humour is as different thro the main Land of the
    Highlands, in-so-far that they who have seen these Places are able,
    at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his
    Residence ...."^[244] <#cite_note-Scarlett/Stewart/
    Dunbar_Martin-277> Scarlett (1990) says some earlier writers used
    this to just assume "a fully organised system of District tartans at
    that time" though Martin said nothing of the sort.^[245]
    <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_34-278> Scarlett considered Martin's
    account to have "a rather sweeping style that suggests some
    exaggeration", but generally plausible on other evidence of
    particular patterns, with minor variations, being common across wide
    areas.^[245] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_34-278>
35. *^ <#cite_ref-288>* These tartan jackets are not to be confused with
    the later short regimental Highland doublet <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublet_(Highland_dress)> styles, borrowed
    directly from the military Highland regiments <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_regiments> starting in the late 18th
    century; these are also of plain colour, not tartan.
36. *^ <#cite_ref-296>* Sources conflict sharply on the date. Telfer
    Dunbar (1979), relying on Mackay Scobie, says 1717-1739;^[260]
    <#cite_note-295> while Eslea MacDonald (2016), relying on R. W.
    Munro's /Highland Clans & Tartans/ (1977), says 1754.^[166]
    <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2016-189>
37. *^ <#cite_ref-302>* Banks & de La Chapelle (2007) give an
    implausible 1724 date for the founding of Wilsons,^[265]
    <#cite_note-BanksdeLaChapell_100-301> but this does not agree with
    other scholarship, and they cite no source for the assertion.
38. *^ <#cite_ref-303>* Scarlett (2008): "Red, blue and green have been
    recorded as the first colours to appear in all primitive art, so
    there may be some deep physiological or psychological reason for the
    predominance of these colours."^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7>
39. *^ <#cite_ref-306>* Britain has many native plants that can produce
    at least a thin yellow, but they seem not to have been favoured,
    except as a ground-colour for over-dyeing with blue to create
    green.^[267] <#cite_note-305>
40. *^ <#cite_ref-321>* A small piece of tartan believed to be from a
    plaid of Bonnie Prince Charlie, given in 1746 to Lady Anne
    Mackintosh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Mackintosh> of Clan
    Farquharson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Farquharson>,
    survives in the National Records of Scotland <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Records_of_Scotland>.^[159]
    <#cite_note-SRT_NRS-181> The prince apparently had a habit of giving
    out plaids as thanks for hospitality, and several recorded (but
    quite different) tartans are said to have come from these plaids,
    e.g. SRT 4220,^[277] <#cite_note-316> 4421,^[278] <#cite_note-317>
    4422,^[279] <#cite_note-318> and 4423.^[280] <#cite_note-319>
    According to Telfer Dunbar (1979), various museums and other
    collections hold at least 40 pieces of tartan claimed to have been
    worn by "the Young Pretender", eight at the Battle of Culloden, and
    they cannot all be genuine.^[281] <#cite_note-320> One sample in
    particular is more likely than the others to be legitimate.^[65]
    <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2014-11-77>
41. *^ <#cite_ref-331>* There are several other tartans called
    "Jacobite". One dates to c. 1850,^[68] <#cite_note-
    SRT_Jacobite,_Old-80> or might be a bit older and is probably a
    Wilsons design,^[33] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2022-37> and the
    others are more recent commercial inventions of c. 1930^[289]
    <#cite_note-329> and the late 20th century.^[290] <#cite_note-330>
42. *^ <#cite_ref-334>* Telfer Dunbar (1979) says the correct year is
    1725 and that 1729 was an error introduced by Stewart of Garth
    (1822) and copied by later authors.^[213] <#cite_note-
    TelferDunbar1979_155-242>
43. *^ <#cite_ref-342>* Specifically, as defined in an earlier act of
    Parliament, north of the "Highland line" running from Perth in the
    east to Dumbarton in the west.^[299] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald2012_3-341>
44. *^ <#cite_ref-343>* The Dress Act /per se/ did not enumerate
    exceptions for the nobility, but the enclosing Act of Proscription did.
45. *^ <#cite_ref-357>* Lt.-Col. Sir John MacGregor Murray <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_John_Macgregor_Murray,_1st_Baronet>, newly
    chief of Clan Gregor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor> and
    later vice-president of the Highland Society of London, wrote of the
    difficulty of raising a new regiment, in 1803: "It will require much
    to rekindle the martial spirit of our ancestors, which has,
    unfortunately, been systematically broken down – we were so long
    degraded by the privation of our arms and dress, and so much
    unmanned by being converted into manufacturers".^[312] <#cite_note-356>
46. *^ <#cite_ref-412>* Not to be confused with the second Seaforth's
    Highlanders, also raised as the 78th, in 1793. The original
    Seaforth's Highlanders were amalgamated with other units under the
    Childers Reforms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childers_Reforms> to
    become the 1881 Seaforth Highlanders <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

48. *^ <#cite_ref-441>* The commercial tartan weaver D. C. Dalgliesh
    provides a list of those that they supply, and it includes a mix of
    obscure tartans from defunct regiments, ones still used today for
    surviving regiments, tartans of overseas units that were "Highland"
    only in name, some that are now only associated with clans, and a
    number that are/were reserved for military pipe-band use and were
    not used in regular dress or undress uniforms.^[393] <#cite_note-440>
49. *^ <#cite_ref-456>* As one example, in /The Lockhart Papers
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lockhart_Papers>/, first
    published in 1714, is a passage describing how opposing battatlions
    of MacDonalds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacDonald> from
    different places could only tell each other apart by colour of
    bonnet cockade. D. W. Stewart (1893) leapt to the conclusion they
    must have worn the same tartan, despite the material saying nothing
    of the sort^[407] <#cite_note-StewartDW_Lockhart-455> (they could
    have been wearing whatever tartans they happened to have, not
    uniforms, making tartan meaningless for distinguishing units of
    men).^[132] <#cite_note-Thompson1992_iv-150>
50. *^ <#cite_ref-458>* D. W. Stewart (1893) sometimes leaned toward the
    uniform interpretation: "It appears from the regulations issued to
    the retainers of the Clan Grant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_Grant> anent <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anent> the wearing
    of a uniform tartan that distinctive patterns were in use, at least
    for military purpose, or on occasion of great gatherings".^[250]
    <#cite_note-StewartDW_29-284> The Grant case is covered in detail
    later.
51. *^ <#cite_ref-459>* D. W. Stewart (1893) again came down on the
    "uniform" side, despite otherwise being a booster of the idea of
    early clan tartans;^[242] <#cite_note-StewartDW_22-23-275> so did
    Scarlett (1990).^[243] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_13-276>
52. *^ <#cite_ref-461>* Adam (1908/1970) confirmed that there were two
    different grades of tartan worn,^[179] <#cite_note-Adam_387-203> as
    did Logan (1831), but both are sources of dubious quality. Scarlett
    (1990, 2008) also observes that there were once at least two kinds
    of tartan weave, a coarse, dense sort in which the weft threads were
    thicker than the warp,^[7] <#cite_note-Scarlett2008-7> and a finer
    equal-twill weave, seen often in portraits, that is more like the
    kilt cloth produced today.^[261] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_22-297>
    (But he does not describe one as being specially intended for war.)
    Such a fineness split seems to have continued for a long time;
    Wilsons of Bannockburn manufactured regimental tartan in both coarse
    ("hard tartan") and fine qualities as late as 1819,^[409]
    <#cite_note-460> perhaps as an undress and dress distinction, or
    enlisted and officer.
53. *^ <#cite_ref-468>* Innes of Learney's motte-and-bailey tactic
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy> when it
    comes to what "clan tartan" means is exemplified by his supposition
    that similar tartans used in lands of Murray <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray>, Murray of Athol <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Atholl>, and Sutherland <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Sutherland> must mean they went back to a
    common tribal tartan "from the twelfth century" (which is not
    attested), and that: "It was no doubt 'the Murrays' tartan' without
    being '/The/ Murray tartan'".^[153] <#cite_note-
    Innes_of_Learney_10-173>
54. *^ <#cite_ref-473>* E.g., the district tartan <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Huntly_district_tartan,_tileable.png> of
    Huntly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntly>^[304] <#cite_note-
    SRT_Huntly-348> was sometimes called Brodie <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Brodie>, sometimes associated instead
    with Forbes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Forbes> or Gordon
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon>, while Forbes did not
    have a distinct clan tartan until the key date of 1822, nor Brodie
    until the beginning of the 19th century.^[418] <#cite_note-471> The
    several tartans named Gordon all date to 1798 or later (and that
    earliest one was adopted from a 1793 regimental tartan).^[419]
    <#cite_note-472>
55. *^ <#cite_ref-479>* However, not only is it not certain that a
    single cloth of mixed colours was intended, rather than three cloths
    of distinct colours, Stewart contradicted himself: When the lands in
    question were restored to the MacLeans in 1630, the grey did not
    revert to green but remained gras, i.e. grey. Nevertheless, Stewart
    asserted: "The explanation is simple enough. White and black and
    green are the only colours in the oldest authenticated Mac Lean
    tartan."^[423] <#cite_note-477> But that design dates only to the
    fraudulent 1842 /Vestiarium Scoticum/ and is not "authenticated" by
    anything;^[424] <#cite_note-478> several other (red-based) MacLean
    tartans date to at least 1819 (/STR/ reference nos. 2603, 2605, and
    2606).
56. *^ <#cite_ref-483>* The Scottish Tartans Society seemed to think it
    was something very similar to Black Watch <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/42nd_Regiment_of_Foot>, with the red-and-white-striped Murray
    of Pulrossie version somehow, despite its 1618 prohibition,
    eventually becoming the primary Sutherland tartan.^[425]
    <#cite_note-480> Innes of Learney also supported the interpretation
    that it was a dark Black Watch-style tartan, related to others used
    in the region.^[394] <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_9-10-442> On the
    other hand, House of Gordon USA, a clan society, proclaims: "It was
    a Red Gordon!",^[426] <#cite_note-481> referring to a primarily red
    and teal tartan, also known as old Huntly <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/File:Old_Huntly_or_Gordon_Red_(1819)_tartan,_tileable.png>,
    recorded in 1819,^[427] <#cite_note-482> and appearing in a
    "stripey" variant, with differing warp and weft, in the 1766
    painting of William Gordon <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    File:William_Gordon_Batoni.jpg>. The society does not publish any
    basis for their assertion.
57. *^ <#cite_ref-486>* The piper's name was William Cumming. Telfer
    Dunbar (1979) describes this tartan, and that of a companion
    portrait of Alastair Grant Mòr "the Champion", as also showing thin
    yellow over-checks which are not really visible in this photo. He
    also describes the green as "grey".^[429] <#cite_note-485>
58. *^ <#cite_ref-494>* This problem of no consistent tartans in old
    family portraits recurs in other clans, such as Murray <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Murray> and MacDonald <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Donald>, going back to the 18th
    century.^[396] <#cite_note-Ward_Edwards-444> Trevor-Roper (1983)
    also notes this inconsistency among Highland portraits,^[175]
    <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_23-199> as does Haswell Miller
    (1956).^[398] <#cite_note-HaswellMiller1956-446>
59. *^ <#cite_ref-498>* Willie Scobie, in 2012, railed against "an
    influential and determined body of opinion set against the idea of
    clan tartans having existed prior to the late 18th century",
    analysed the /Tartana/ lines in light of known clan tartans, found
    no correspondences aside from the Royal Company of Archers
    (supposedly using a Stuart tartan, which in reality they did
    not,^[246] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012-280> and not being a clan
    anyway) having green edging on their jackets, and nevertheless
    decided: "we have in this piece of literature strong (one is almost
    tempted to say irrefutable) evidence of the existence of clan
    tartans in the year 1718."^[439] <#cite_note-497>
60. *^ <#cite_ref-518>* Thompson (1992)^[132] <#cite_note-
    Thompson1992_iv-150> said none of them survive; but the coat of the
    older boy is in what is now known as "MacDonald, Lord of the Isles",
    though the sett was reconstructed from the painting.^[458]
    <#cite_note-517>
61. *^ <#cite_ref-528>* A legend started by Lord Archibald Campbell
    (1890), who was working from a copy of the painting not the
    original, is that in his words: "No more conclusive proof of
    distinctive clan colours has been exhibited and it silences all
    dispute on the question at once and for all time."^[465]
    <#cite_note-525> Modern researchers do not take this seriously.
    E.g., J. Telfer Dunbar's evaluation: "This is an extraordinary claim
    as the tartans are clearly and accurately shown and not one of them
    agree with any clan tartans as known when Lord Archibald was writing
    or even to-day."^[187] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_CampbellA-213>
    Scarlett (1990) pointed out that Campbell himself claimed, later in
    1899, that the models for the painting were Jacobite
    prisoners.^[466] <#cite_note-526> If that were the case, they could
    be wearing whatever they were told to put on, even material supplied
    by the painter; i.e. the tartans depicted would be accurate
    representations of the cloth of the period but could not signify
    anything, even if they did match. The Jacobite Relics and Rare
    Scottish Antiquities Exhibition of 1946 agreed that the models were
    prisoners.^[467] <#cite_note-527>
62. *^ <#cite_ref-531>* James Ray, who served in the government forces
    at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: "In their flight I came up
    with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your
    Hand, I'm a Cambell. On which I asked him, Where's your Bonnet? He
    reply'd, Somebody have snatched it off my Head. I only mention this
    to shew how we distinguished our loyal Clans from the Rebels; they
    being dress'd and equip'd all in one Way, except the Bonnet; ours
    having a red or yellow Cross of Cloath or Ribbon; theirs a white
    Cockade".^[468] <#cite_note-529> Telfer Dunbar (1979): "If it had
    been possible to distinguish a Campbell by a 'Clan Campbell' tartan,
    either Ray would have done so or else remarked on the fact that the
    man was not wearing an identifiable tartan."^[469] <#cite_note-530>
63. *^ <#cite_ref-533>* /A Journal of the Expedition of Prince Charles
    Edward in 1745, by a Highland Officer/ provides this account: "We
    M'Donalds were much preplex'd, in the event of ane ingagement, how
    to distinguish ourselves from our bretheren and nighbours the
    M'Donalds of Sky, seeing we were both Highlanders and both wore
    heather in our bonnets, only our white cockades made some
    distinction".^[407] <#cite_note-StewartDW_Lockhart-455> Telfer
    Dunbar (1979): "If all the MacDonalds wore the same tartan, surely
    the writer would have mentioned this rather than the heather which
    they wore in their bonnets. A common tartan would have been much
    more confusing than a sprig of heather."^[470] <#cite_note-
    TelferDunbar1979_20-532> Also, this particular case does not
    demonstrate that /all/ the clans had different emblematic plants.
    Clan plants, like clan tartans, were solicited from chiefs in the
    early 19th century by the Highland Society of London, and there is
    no evidence of widespread assignment before then – only this single-
    clan mention in one period source.
64. *^ <#cite_ref-537>* And because the belted plaid in particular, as
    very practical for outdoor wear but not as work clothing, was
    believed to be conducive to a life of idle shirking and outright
    banditry.^[473] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_4-536>
65. *^ <#cite_ref-541>* Even the Sutherland/Pulrossie letter of 1618
    referred specifically to "the plaides of his men",^[394]
    <#cite_note-Innes_of_Learney_9-10-442> which is suggestive of his
    militia, not his entire clan.
66. *^ <#cite_ref-549>* Sometimes said to be Jean "Jenny" Cameron
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cameron_of_Glendessary>, without
    conclusive evidence; there are five other identity candidates.^[483]
    <#cite_note-548>
67. *^ <#cite_ref-550>* Another legend, started by James Grant (1886),
    has it that the tartan goes back to "Charles, first Earl of Dunmore
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Murray,_1st_Earl_of_Dunmore>,
    second son of the first Marquis of Tullibardine", but this was just
    a bad mis-reading of the Smith brothers (1850), from whom Grant
    plagiarised, referring to the /then-current/ Earl of Dunmore.^[316]
    <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-a-361> ^[8] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald_2010-11-b-8>
68. *^ <#cite_ref-559>* E.g., Telfer Dunbar (1979) provides this
    example: Wilsons' popular "Gordon" was green, purple, and black with
    over-checks of seven colours, and "unlike the present clan
    pattern".^[431] <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_146-488>
69. *^ <#cite_ref-572>* One example is today's Macpherson <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Macpherson>, adopted in 1817, which was
    originally "Caledonia" then "No. 43", "No. 155", or "Kidd" in
    Wilsons' pattern books.^[388] <#cite_note-Newsome_2005-435> ^[492]
    <#cite_note-Tuckett_17-560> (There is no "Clan Kidd"; the Kidd in
    question was a bulk orderer who used the tartan to clothe slaves in
    the West Indies.^[493] <#cite_note-Trevor-Roper_30-561> Confusion
    seems to have arisen when Wilson also assigned the pattern the name
    "Macpherson" after another West Indies customer by that name.^[494]
    <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2012_5-562> Another is Campbell of Cawdor
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Campbell_of_Cawdor>, originally
    "No. 230" or "Argyll <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argyll>", after
    the county.^[495] <#cite_note-563> ^[496] <#cite_note-564> A complex
    example is the case of Abercrombie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Abercrombie_(surname)> or Abercromby <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Abercromby_(name)>.^[497] <#cite_note-565> Logan (1831) first
    published the tartan usually used for this name, but he modified
    it^[498] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_64-566> from an 1805 Wilsons
    tartan record for "No. 64" or "Abercrombie", named for Sir Ralph
    Abercrombie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Abercrombie> not an
    entire family.^[499] <#cite_note-567> The design first popular for
    "Abercrombie" in the early 18th century changed names somehow^[498]
    <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_64-566> to Graham <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Graham> then later became today's Graham
    of Montrose <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrose,_Angus>
    tartan.^[500] <#cite_note-568> Wilsons' "Abercromby with
    yellow"^[498] <#cite_note-Scarlett1990_64-566> is today's Campbell
    of Breadalbane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Campbell_of_Breadalbane>^[501] <#cite_note-569> after also being
    used by a fencible regiment.^[502] <#cite_note-570> The main
    Buchanan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Buchanan> tartan,
    famous for being asymmetric, originated as a Wilsons fashion tartan
    around 1800 and was not adopted as a clan tartan until the
    1830s.^[35] <#cite_note-SRT_Buchanan-41> "Logan" was invented by
    Wilsons, named after a merchant, and changed several times until it
    sold well.^[503] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_149-571> "Drummond" was
    originally Wilsons' "Perth".^[503] <#cite_note-DunbarJD1979_149-571>
    Wilson's 1819 pattern "Regent" turned into the MacLaren <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacLaren> clan tartan by 1830, with a
    shift from purple to blue.^[97] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald2012_9-114> Scarlett (1990) and the Scottish Register
    of Tartans provide numerous other examples of modern "clan" tartans
    actually just being renamed generic/fashion/fancy, regimental, and
    famous-individual tartans from Wilsons, when they were not taken
    from the later forgery /Vestiarium Scoticum/.
70. *^ <#cite_ref-578>* A prime example is the Black Watch tartan, which
    Cockburn collected four times and assigned the names "Campbell
    Argyll", "Grant", "Munro" and "Sutherland".^[508] <#cite_note-577>
    ^[506] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575>
71. *^ <#cite_ref-587>* According to a documentary, Clan Gregor
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor>, the Gordons <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gordon>, and a MacDonald <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Donald> branch might also have had early
    informal clan tartans around this period.^[173] <#cite_note-
    Spinning-197> However, the chief of the MacDonalds indicated not
    knowing of a clan tartan in 1815, and the tartan that was the
    subject of the 1618 Gordon/Murray/Sutherland letter is uncertain.
72. *^ <#cite_ref-594>* Stewart of Garth may have had financial
    motivations for promoting an aristocratic "tartanry" or
    "Highlandism" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartanry> and attaching
    his name to it prominently – like many other Scottish lairds
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird>, he was in dire fiscal
    shape.^[522] <#cite_note-593>
73. *^ <#cite_ref-602>* At least six at once claimed the Black Watch
    regimental tartan,^[506] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575> ^[523]
    <#cite_note-PatersonMB_158-159-595> and "Several chiefs were asked
    to resubmit a different tartan in order to be seen to be different
    and thus support the idea of historical clan tartans."^[506]
    <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2023-575> In some cases, minor alterations
    were made, e.g. Forbes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Forbes>
    was devised in 1822 by adding a white over-check to Black
    Watch.^[529] <#cite_note-601>
74. *^ <#cite_ref-604>* There are numerous examples, but a prominent
    case is that two of the Lord of the Isles <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Lord_of_the_Isles> tartan variants were taken from portraits
    dating to the third quarter of the 18th century.^[530]
    <#cite_note-603> This practice, incidentally, has contributed to
    confusion about the age of clan tartans; a tartan adopted officially
    by a clan in 1850 from a painting dating to 1750 might misleadingly
    be said to be "a clan tartan dating to 1750".
75. *^ <#cite_ref-614>* The authenticated samples bore seals of clan
    chiefs, while submissions received without such authentications were
    sealed by society secretary George Wedderburn.^[57] <#cite_note-
    EsleaMacDonald_2012-01-68> The society collected tartans in general
    as well, and amassed 586 by 1987.^[523] <#cite_note-
    PatersonMB_158-159-595>
76. *^ <#cite_ref-630>* Some faulty (according to Wilsons) clan patterns
    included in Logan (1831) were those for Abercrombie <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Abercrombie>, Douglas <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Douglas>, and Graham <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Graham>, but there were more.^[553]
    <#cite_note-TelferDunbar1979_153-628>
77. *^ <#cite_ref-641>* In fairness, only most of the tartans in /
    Vestiarium/ were made up; almost a dozen had previously appeared in
    collections like those of Cockburn and Wilson.^[562]
    <#cite_note-638> Telfer Dunbar (1979) also considered that the
    Sobieski Stuarts' more general material on the history and then-
    present of Highland dress was of considerable value, at least when
    its sources could be traced.^[563] <#cite_note-639> Of the tartans
    material, Walter Scott <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Scott>
    fairly charitably wrote that the brothers had "an exaggerating
    imagination, which possibly deceives even themselves".^[564]
    <#cite_note-640>
78. *^ <#cite_ref-648>* R. Martin (1988): "I would like to excuse the
    prevarications of the Sobieski-Stuart brothers with a nod to
    Baudrillard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard>; they
    lied and they cheated, but they did something quite extraordinary in
    ascribing a meaning to textile design that has more or less stuck:
    false as it is, the Sobieski-Stuarts fostered a myth of textile
    identification and implication that has served a continuing and
    compelling social need for well over a hundred years. They may have
    been factually wrong, but culturally very right."^[570]
    <#cite_note-647>
79. *^ <#cite_ref-659>* E.g., the usual tartan of Clan Home <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Home> dates to /Clans Originaux/.^[579]
    <#cite_note-657> Another is Brodie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_Brodie> hunting;^[580] <#cite_note-658> it was also later
    included in /Old & Rare Scottish Tartans/. A third is MacBean.^[115]
    <#cite_note-SRT_MacBean-132>
80. *^ <#cite_ref-672>* See Scarlett (1990), chapter "The Setts of the
    Tartans", for numerous examples of names with 5 or even 10 "clan
    tartans", most of them traceable to Wilsons, Logan, or the Sobieski
    Stewarts.^[592] <#cite_note-671> For a quick visual example of
    conflicting claimed clan tartans, many of them dating to the
    Victorian to Edwardian periods, see the "MacDougal" search results
    in the /Scottish Register of Tartans/;^[84] <#cite_note-
    SRT_MacDougal-97> the list for that name is not much polluted by
    recent individual and "fashion" entries.
81. *^ <#cite_ref-677>* Revised in 1974, D. C. Stewart's /The Setts of
    the Scottish Tartans/ has been further updated and expanded by James
    D. Scarlett in 1990 as /Tartan: The Highland Textile/,^[596]
    <#cite_note-676> perhaps the most definitive work on tartan
    published so far (though by no means the largest in terms of number
    of tartans illustrated; it is a book of research not of pictures).
82. *^ <#cite_ref-680>* E.g. the red variant of the 1975 MacGregor dance
    tartan dates to 2005.^[598] <#cite_note-679>
83. *^ <#cite_ref-683>* /Electric Scotland/ published an annotated list
    of clans and their tartans' Lord Lyon registration status. The list
    is much shorter than some other clan lists, because it omits clans
    that have not applied to the Lord Lyon for tartan registry at all;
    it lists only those with Lyon-recorded tartans or those then in
    process of such registration.^[600] <#cite_note-LL_list-682>
84. *^ <#cite_ref-685>* Example: The Clan Watson <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Watson> tartan dates to c. 1932 and
    appears to have been created by one of two ministers (sources
    disagree), based on the MacRae hunting and Gordon tartans.^[601]
    <#cite_note-684>
85. *^ <#cite_ref-688>* The Highland MacLennans <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_MacLennan> use the same tartan as the
    Lowland Logans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Logan>. Clan
    Logan is without a chief <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Armigerous_clan>.
86. *^ <#cite_ref-710>* Eslea MacDonald (2022) defines this "Highland
    Revival" period as the 1782 end of the Dress Act to the beginning of
    Victoria's reign in 1837.^[33] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald2022-37>
    The utility and accuracy of this term when constratined to
    Victoria's accession is questionable, because revivalism of Highland
    cultural trappings did not abate during her reign but actually
    intensified markedly. Also, the term /tartan revival/ has been used,
    with essentially the same meaning, though without closely prescribed
    dates.^[624] <#cite_note-709>
87. *^ <#cite_ref-714>* In this era, soldiering, especially as an
    officer, was the "aristocratic profession /par excellence/",^[626]
    <#cite_note-712> and this had a strong effect on fashion. In
    Highland dress of the period, sometimes civilian and military styles
    were commingled.^[627] <#cite_note-713>
88. *^ <#cite_ref-727>* Not to universal approval. The chief of Clan
    MacDonell of Glengarry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_MacDonell_of_Glengarry> wrote of a Celtic Society of Edinburgh
    gathering: "I never saw so much tartan before in my life, with so
    little Highland material ... they have no right to burlesque the
    national character or dress of the Highlands."^[528] <#cite_note-
    Armstrong_37-600>
89. *^ <#cite_ref-731>* David Wilkie <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    David_Wilkie_(artist)>'s portrait of George IV <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom> depicts the
    king as being much slimmer than he actually was. Wilkie covered up
    the fact the king's kilt was too short – sitting well above the
    knees – and also left out the pink tights the king wore to hide his
    bare legs.^[642] <#cite_note-730>
90. *^ <#cite_ref-775>* A detailed summary of the 19th-century tartan
    books can be found in D. W. Stewart (1893) <#SDW>, pp. 57–61.
91. *^ <#cite_ref-786>* Queen Victoria wrote of her time in Scotland:
    "... I feel a sort of reverence in going over these scenes in this
    most beautiful country, which I am proud to call my own, where there
    was such devoted loyalty to the family of my ancestors – for Stuart
    blood <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Stuart> is in my
    veins, and I am now their representative, and the people are as
    devoted and loyal to me as they were to that unhappy race".^[695]
    <#cite_note-785>
92. *^ <#cite_ref-794>* There were "tartanitis"-infused travel books of
    the era to go along with the tourism, e.g. /A Tour in Tartan-land/
    by Rev. Edward "Cuthbert Bede" Bradley <https://en.wikipedia.org/

    last of these is inexplicably assigned a date of 1863 in /SRT/, but
    with a note that seems to indicate it was designed by D. G. Teall of
    STS in 1981.

100. *^ <#cite_ref-999>* For example, Bruce County <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_County> has an official tartan.^[898]
    <#cite_note-997> An example of a Canadian municipality with an
    official tartan is Beauport, Quebec City <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Beauport,_Quebec_City>.^[899] <#cite_note-998>
101. *^ <#cite_ref-1010>* E.g., Matheson <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Clan_Matheson> dress^[906] <#cite_note-SRT_Matheson-1006> is also
    known simply as Matheson, and is distinguished from a Matheson
    hunting tartan.^[907] <#cite_note-1007> As with many Scottish names,
    there are an accumulation of other fashion and individual tartan
    designs named "Matheson",^[908] <#cite_note-1008> but the only two
    recognised by the Clan Matheson Society are Matheson [dress] and
    Matheson hunting.^[909] <#cite_note-1009> Similarly, Shaw of
    Tordarroch <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Shaw> dress^[606]
    <#cite_note-SRT_Shaw_dress-691> is the main tartan, and is
    distinguished from a hunting variant,^[607] <#cite_note-
    SRT_Shaw_hunting-692> with the old, erroneous "Shaw" tartan being
    retained only as a memorial tartan for a particular family
    figure.^[605] <#cite_note-SRT_Shaw-690>
102. *^ <#cite_ref-1015>* A photo in Adam (1908/1970) confirms that
    tartans with white stripes were used for Highland dance outfits at
    least as far back as the Edwardian period, though the style of
    female dance-competition dress <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
    Aboyne_dress> has notably changed toward kilt-length instead of mid-
    calf skirts since then.^[913] <#cite_note-1014>
103. *^ <#cite_ref-1017>* Some writers have confused them as late as the
    1980s (which suggests that dance tartans as a /conventional/
    category unto themselves may date to the 1990s and later, though
    some specific dance tartans date to at least the mid-1970s).^[914]
    <#cite_note-SRT_MacGregors-1016> E.g., J. C. Thompson (1989)
    conflates dance and dress tartans and treats all dress tartans as if
    they were white-bearing,^[102] <#cite_note-Thompson_color-119>
    despite the clear fact that some dress tartans of considerable age
    do not have white in them, e.g. Matheson <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Clan_Matheson> dress from c. 1850.^[906] <#cite_note-
    SRT_Matheson-1006>
104. *^ <#cite_ref-1019>* The white-heavy MacGregor dance tartan (in
    three colour variants dating to 1975–2005) is confusingly listed in
    the /Scottish Register of Tartans/ as both dance and dress,^[914]
    <#cite_note-SRT_MacGregors-1016> but the chief of Clan Gregor
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Gregor> insists it is for
    dancers only,^[602] <#cite_note-Malcolm_MacGregor-686> so it is
    demonstrably not a general dress-wear tartan. Several other dance
    tartans are listed also as dress tartans in the /SRT/, but most
    appear to be "fashion" inventions by individuals or by woollen mills
    and are not associated with clans or districts.^[915] <#cite_note-
    SRT_dance-1018>
105. *^ <#cite_ref-1021>* Possibly as early as 1850, and based on the Hay
    Stewart tartan or on royal Stewart, both probably by the Sobieski
    Stuarts.^[689] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2019-06-779> It is often
    misdated to 1853.^[916] <#cite_note-1020>
106. *^ <#cite_ref-1024>* An example of a writer uncritically
    perpetuating the story can be found in M. B. Paterson (2001).^[918]
    <#cite_note-1023>
107. *^ <#cite_ref-1027>* As noted above, an early regimental tartan of
    1787 was for a while called "Mackenzie–MacLeod" after two
    commanders, but this was a troop uniform tartan, not one for the
    named individuals.
108. *^ <#cite_ref-1030>* The sett actually survives in two variants in
    the /SRT/, created for an 1880 wedding; they are now sometimes used
    as Wilson family tartans.^[921] <#cite_note-1028> ^[922]
    <#cite_note-1029>
109. *^ <#cite_ref-1041>* The Lord Lyon would only accept formal clan
    tartan registrations from clan chiefs; this excluded chiefless
    armigerous clans <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armigerous_clan>
    from tartan registration with the Lord Lyon, whether or not they had
    latter-day clan associations/societies. However, many now-armigerous
    clans /were/ able to register tartans with the Lord Lyon before they
    became chiefless, and these registrations remain in the Lyon Court
    Books. The Lord Lyon seemed to consider a clan that /has had/ a
    chief to remain a clan and not just a family/surname (the Lord Lyon
    did not do any registration of family tartans, i.e. those for non-
    clan surnames), though a statement by the Lord Lyon on this matter
    in 2002 is not as clearly worded as it could have been.^[600]
    <#cite_note-LL_list-682>
110. *^ <#cite_ref-1056>* In 2003, Burberry <https://en.wikipedia.org/
    wiki/Burberry> demanded members of the tartan industry to stop
    trading a certain Thomson Camel tartan.^[944] <#cite_note-1053>
    Burberry claimed this tartan was confusingly similar to their
    Burberry check and that it thus infringed their registered
    trademark.^[945] <#cite_note-1054> Burberry took legal action again
    in 2013 to protect its tartan trademark in China.^[946]
    <#cite_note-1055>
111. *^ <#cite_ref-1082>* For example, the Clan Cameron Association
    website states that the Cameron of Lochiel tartan "is the personal
    tartan of the Chief and his immediate family; as a rule it should
    not be worn by clansfolk".^[971] <#cite_note-1081>
112. *^ <#cite_ref-1086>* Since 1937, the only non-royals permitted by
    the British royal family to wear the Balmoral tartan are the
    monarch's own personal piper and pipers at the royal Balmoral
    estate. Even royal family members only wear it with the permission
    of the monarch.^[689] <#cite_note-EsleaMacDonald_2019-06-779> The
    official website of the monarchy of the United Kingdom <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom> claims the
    tartan is not available for purchase.^[973] <#cite_note-1084> ^[974]
    <#cite_note-1085>
113. *^ <#cite_ref-1100>* Oyange-Ngando (2018): "the intentional and
    specific arrangement of colour where each bears a certain meaning,
    for example a colour arrangement could represent age, clan or
    marital status of an individual". Oyange-Ngando's paper cites many
    sources, but cites none at all for this claim. Modern photos of
    Maasai show members of the same tribe/clan wearing a wide variety
    of /shúkà/ patterns, seemingly to taste.
114. *^ <#cite_ref-1107>* They are prescribed dress in at least in the
    more populous places. Remote areas, inhabited largely by ethnic
    minorities, still exhibit local traditional dress norms that differ
    from area to area.^[993] <#cite_note-1106>
115. *^ <#cite_ref-1110>* Just /Bumthang/ by itself is a term for a type
    of woolen cloth, regardless of pattern.^[995] <#cite_note-1109>
116. *^ <#cite_ref-1128>* Not to be confused with the Mongols <https://
    en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols>, who were called "Ta[r]tars" by
    medieval Europeans, and supplied patterned cloth among other trade
    goods (see § Medieval <#Medieval>, above).
